       " ['General Grade Appeal\\nGrades are determined solely by the individual faculty who taught the course for the session(s) or the semester(s). A student who wishes to contest a grade must first attempt to resolve the matter with the course faculty.\\nIf the matter cannot be resolved with the instructor, the student may appeal to the appropriate Dean of School. The student must provide the evidence as to why the grade posted by the faculty is an error. if the matter is not resolved with the Dean of School, the student may appeal a final time to the Academic Standards Committee. The decision of the Academic Standards committee is final.\\nGrades may be appealed within one academic year. The Grade Appeal Form can be obtained by Office of the Registrar and will guide students through each of the three steps.\\nGrade Point Average (GPA) System\\nGrade Point Average (GPA) refers to the average grade at any particular time during, or at the end of, any particular semester. It is determined by the total number of Quality Points Earned (QPE) divided by total number of credits.\\nThe Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) is the average for all courses taken at the college. It is computed by taking the sum of all Quality Points Earned (QPE) while in attendance at Diné College divided by the sum of all eligible credit hours earned.\\nQuality points are figured as follows: A = 4 quality points, B = 3 quality points, C = 2 quality points, D = 1 quality point, and F = 0. For instance, if a student receives an A in ENG 101 (3 credits x 4 quality points = 12 QPE), B in MTH 106 (3 credits x 3 quality points = 9 QPE), and C in PSY 111 (3 credits x 2 quality points = 6 QPE), that person’s GPA would be 3.00 (27 total quality points divided by 9 credits = 3.00).\\nThe following rules are considered in computing the CGPA:\\nCourses that are repeated are counted only once for credit and the CGPA; however, all repeated courses appear on the student’s transcript.\\nThe higher grade is used for computing the CGPA whenever a course is repeated.\\nCertain courses can be repeated for credit and therefore are exempt from the two rules above (e.g., 099, 199, and 299 courses; students should consult with their advisor).\\nWhen grades of “I” or “IP” have been changed to letter grades, they are computed in the CGPA.\\nA “CR” grade is computed in the total credit hours earned, but is not included in the CGPA.\\nIndividual instructors or academic divisions have specific policies and requirements for the “IP” grade. Students are advised to check each course syllabus carefully to be informed about the “IP” grade policy for courses.\\nF, a failing grade, is shown on the transcript and computed in the CGPA unless the student retakes the course and passes, at which time the passing grade is entered on the transcript and the quality points are computed in the CGPA and the semester GPA.\\nMidterm and Final Grade Report\\nThe midterm examinations occur during the 8th week of classes during the Fall and Spring semesters. Midterm grades are not entered on the permanent record. Final examinations are scheduled at the end of the semester and must be taken during scheduled times.\\nRepeating Courses\\nStudents may repeat courses previously taken at the College to better their understanding or to improve their grades. A transcript shows that the course was repeated, but only the higher grade is used to compute the student’s CGPA). Repeating or retaking a class can affect a student’s financial aid. (Please see repeat or retake in Financial Aid Policies.',\n",
       "  'Academic Appeals\\nStudents placed on academic probation or suspension may appeal to the Academic Standards Committee by filing an appeal form with the Office of the Registrar. The student has the right to appeal any action affecting their academic status by obtaining the appropriate form from the Office of the Registrar: Appeal of Suspension, Appeal of Probation, Grade Appeal, or General Appeal.\\nAcademic Integrity\\nStudents are responsible for the integrity of their academic work. Examples of academic dishonesty include but are not limited to, obtaining unauthorized assistance in any academic work; cheating on a test; plagiarism; quoting without proper credit; modifying any examination, paper, record, report or project without the instructor’s approval for obtaining additional credit or an improved grade; and, representing the work of others as one’s own. Some of the penalties that may be imposed include: warning (written or oral); reducing the grade for the assignment, test, or project; reducing the grade for the course; assigning a failing grade for the course; dismissing the student from the course and issuing a grade of “W”; academic probation or suspension; expulsion; and recording the decision in the student’s academic record.\\nAcademic Probation\\nStudents who do not maintain a semester GPA of 2.00 are subject to academic probation for the next semester of regular attendance. Academic probation is not recorded on the transcript. The criteria for full- or part-time students are:\\nFull-time students, upon completion of 12 or more semester credit hours, are placed on academic probation if they have a GPA less than 2.00 (higher levels specific to each Bachelor’s program). If the number of semester credit hours drops below 12 as a result of an “In Progress” (IP) grade (see below), students are still considered to be making satisfactory progress.\\nPart-time students, upon completion of 16 or more cumulative semester credit hours, are placed on academic probation when a total of 11 or fewer credit hours of work have been attempted in a semester and cumulative GPA is less than a 2.00.\\nStudents on academic probation may take no more than 14 credit hours per semester unless approved by an advisor.\\nAcademic Recognition\\nAcademic recognition can be achieved as follow:\\nPresident’s Honor List: Students must achieve a semester GPA of 4.00, complete a minimum of 12 credit hours, and receive no grades of “I” or “IP.” “Honors” will be noted on transcript.\\nProvost’s Honor List: Students must achieve a semester GPA of 3.50 –3.99, complete a minimum of 12 credit hours, and receive no grades of “I” or “IP.” “Honors” will be noted on transcript.\\nAcademic Standing\\nStudents must maintain a 2.00 cumulative grade point average (CGPA) throughout their program of study (or higher levels in the Bachelor’s degree programs; consult the program handbooks for details). When students receive final grades of A, B, C, D, or F, they are considered credit hours attempted and earned. W, I, or IP grades earn no credit and are not considered hours completed. Transfer credit hours accepted by Diné College are not calculated in cumulative grade point averages for determining satisfactory progress.\\nAcademic Status Change\\nWhen change of an “Incomplete” (I) or “In Progress” (IP) grade alters a student’s academic status, the student is notified of the change in writing by Office of the Registrar. When the changes are formally adjusted, students are placed on good standing, academic probation or suspension and the restriction is effective immediately.\\nAcademic Suspension\\nStudents who do not satisfactorily meet the required minimum standards during the probationary semester will be placed on academic suspension. Academic suspension means the student will not be permitted to enroll in any classes at Diné College for the semester of the suspension. Upon returning, the student will be placed on academic probation until minimum standards for satisfactory progress are met.\\nAcademic suspension is not recorded on a student’s transcript. Students who are placed on academic probation or academic suspension are subject to additional regulations regarding Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP). A student may appeal academic suspension by obtaining appeal information from the Office of the Registrar. Program-specific policies regarding academic suspension apply to each of the Bachelor’s degree programs. Consult the program handbooks for details.\\nFor more information, contact Office of the Registrar at (928) 724-6630/6631/6632\\nContact Us\\nDiné College—Office of the Registrar\\nP.O.Box C-04\\nTsaile, Arizona, 86556\\nregistrar@dinecollege.edu\\n(928) 724-6630'],\n",
