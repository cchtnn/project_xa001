Completing and submitting the FAFSA form is free, and it gives students access to the largest source of financial aid to help pay for higher education.\\nThe Better FAFSA is simplified, redesigned, and streamlined. It is faster and easier to fill out, with most students and families completing it in less than 15 minutes. It ensures 665,000 more students will receive Federal Pell Grants to pay for college. Additionally, more than 1.7 million more students will receive the maximum Pell Grant.',\n",
