    "Academics": "Academic Appeals\nStudents placed on academic probation or suspension may appeal to the Academic Standards Committee by filing an appeal form with the Office of the Registrar. The student has the right to appeal any action affecting their academic status by obtaining the appropriate form from the Office of the Registrar: Appeal of Suspension, Appeal of Probation, Grade Appeal, or General Appeal.\nAcademic Integrity\nStudents are responsible for the integrity of their academic work. Examples of academic dishonesty include but are not limited to, obtaining unauthorized assistance in any academic work; cheating on a test; plagiarism; quoting without proper credit; modifying any examination, paper, record, report or project without the instructor’s approval for obtaining additional credit or an improved grade; and, representing the work of others as one’s own. Some of the penalties that may be imposed include: warning (written or oral); reducing the grade for the assignment, test, or project; reducing the grade for the course; assigning a failing grade for the course; dismissing the student from the course and issuing a grade of “W”; academic probation or suspension; expulsion; and recording the decision in the student’s academic record.\nAcademic Probation\nStudents who do not maintain a semester GPA of 2.00 are subject to academic probation for the next semester of regular attendance. Academic probation is not recorded on the transcript. The criteria for full- or part-time students are:\nFull-time students, upon completion of 12 or more semester credit hours, are placed on academic probation if they have a GPA less than 2.00 (higher levels specific to each Bachelor’s program). If the number of semester credit hours drops below 12 as a result of an “In Progress” (IP) grade (see below), students are still considered to be making satisfactory progress.\nPart-time students, upon completion of 16 or more cumulative semester credit hours, are placed on academic probation when a total of 11 or fewer credit hours of work have been attempted in a semester and cumulative GPA is less than a 2.00.\nStudents on academic probation may take no more than 14 credit hours per semester unless approved by an advisor.\nAcademic Recognition\nAcademic recognition can be achieved as follow:\nPresident’s Honor List: Students must achieve a semester GPA of 4.00, complete a minimum of 12 credit hours, and receive no grades of “I” or “IP.” “Honors” will be noted on transcript.\nProvost’s Honor List: Students must achieve a semester GPA of 3.50 –3.99, complete a minimum of 12 credit hours, and receive no grades of “I” or “IP.” “Honors” will be noted on transcript.\nAcademic Standing\nStudents must maintain a 2.00 cumulative grade point average (CGPA) throughout their program of study (or higher levels in the Bachelor’s degree programs; consult the program handbooks for details). When students receive final grades of A, B, C, D, or F, they are considered credit hours attempted and earned. W, I, or IP grades earn no credit and are not considered hours completed. Transfer credit hours accepted by Diné College are not calculated in cumulative grade point averages for determining satisfactory progress.\nAcademic Status Change\nWhen change of an “Incomplete” (I) or “In Progress” (IP) grade alters a student’s academic status, the student is notified of the change in writing by Office of the Registrar. When the changes are formally adjusted, students are placed on good standing, academic probation or suspension and the restriction is effective immediately.\nAcademic Suspension\nStudents who do not satisfactorily meet the required minimum standards during the probationary semester will be placed on academic suspension. Academic suspension means the student will not be permitted to enroll in any classes at Diné College for the semester of the suspension. Upon returning, the student will be placed on academic probation until minimum standards for satisfactory progress are met.\nAcademic suspension is not recorded on a student’s transcript. Students who are placed on academic probation or academic suspension are subject to additional regulations regarding Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP). A student may appeal academic suspension by obtaining appeal information from the Office of the Registrar. Program-specific policies regarding academic suspension apply to each of the Bachelor’s degree programs. Consult the program handbooks for details.\nFor more information, contact Office of the Registrar at (928) 724-6630/6631/6632\nContact Us\nDiné College—Office of the Registrar\nP.O.Box C-04\nTsaile, Arizona, 86556\nregistrar@dinecollege.edu\n(928) 724-6630",
    "Administration": "Access to and Confidentiality of Records\nSocial Security or Student Identification Numbers are used for students’ identification and records only. The Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) protects the privacy of such information. The College provides access to specified official records related to the student and an opportunity to change such records if they are inaccurate while providing for the challenge of actual grades received. To ensure that their rights are upheld, students are required to file requests for non-disclosure on an annual basis if withholding of directory information is desired. Such requests will be honored for one academic year.\nOnly the Office of the Registrar and other authorized personnel have access to student files. An authorized personnel is a person employed by the College in an administrative, supervisory, faculty, academic research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel), or other authorized personnel offices; a person or company with whom the College has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Regents; or a student serving on an official committee or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks.\nAdministrative Withdrawal\nThe College reserves the right the right to withdraw a student from classes for any reason when College officials consider this action to be in the best interest of the College or of the students.\nAuditing Courses\nWith the exception of laboratory courses, if space is available and permission is secured from the faculty, a student may audit a course. Full tuition is assessed for audits and confers no credit, grades, or quality points and does not apply toward graduation. A student must declare audit status at the time of registration. Changes from credit to audit or audit to credit are not permitted after the last day to add a class (See Academic Calendar). Audited courses will be noted on the student’s permanent record as “AU” grade.\nChange of Grade\nThe Instructor and Dean of School must approve a grade change. Students wanting to appeal a grade must complete an Academic Grade Appeal form and follow the appeal process. Once course is completed per official last day of class, student(s) cannot submit or resubmit coursework for a higher grade. Circumstances necessitating a change of grade may include a clerical error made by the instructor or data entry personnel in preparing the grade report or the change of an “Incomplete” grade. With the exception of the “I” and the “IP” grade which must be changed by the end of the following semester, a grade may be changed within an academic year from the time it was given. Changes of grades for summer courses must be completed by the end of the following summer session.\nClass Attendance and Punctuality\nStudents are expected to attend all classes and required labs. Instructors will keep attendance records. An absence does not excuse a student from classwork or assignments that are missed. Repeated absences and tardiness that affect student performance will be reflected in the final grade. You are expected to be prompt in attending each of your classes. Excessive tardiness might result in the faculty taking appropriate actions.\nCourse Change or Cancellation\nDiné College reserves the right to cancel any scheduled course or to change the day, time, location, and/or faculty of any course without notice. Students will not be penalized for cancelled courses. Tuition is fully refundable. Technology, and other applicable activity fees are non-refundable.\nCourse Overload\nA full course load normally consists of twelve (12) to sixteen (16) credit hours each semester.

The student must have a 3.00 cumulative GPA or higher, and obtain approval from an assigned advisor and the Dean of School, to take more than 16 credit hours for Fall and Spring. Under no circumstances may a student enroll for more than 21 credit hours in one semester. During the summer, students may take a maximum of 6-8 hours per session and no more than 12-14 total over the summer. Credits earned through Credit by Examination are not counted in this policy.\nCourse Substitution\nThe Course Substitution Request Form is available at all sites and must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar. Students must consult with their assigned advisor prior to graduation. Request for course substitution must be approved by the appropriate Dean of School.\nCredit-by-Examination\nStudents who are currently enrolled in Diné College may apply for credit-by-examination in certain courses by contacting the Dean of School. The Registrar must also grant permission. Students may not petition to challenge a course a second time, nor may they take an exam for a course in which they have previously enrolled. Each academic division may have additional qualifications. Students must register for examinations by the end of the fourth week of classes. Students at the Regional Sites may need to take the exam at the Tsaile Campus. Students must pay for the cost of the examination and the tuition fees, which are non-refundable. The exam and other division requirements must be passed with a grade of A, B, or C for credit to be given. A notation of “Credit by Examination” (CR) is placed on the transcript. The grade is included in the total earned credit hours but is not computed in the total grade point average. Students should note that Diné College’s credit by examination may not transfer to other colleges and universities.\nDefinition of Semester Hour\nAll academic credits earned are expressed in terms of semester hours. A completed semester hour represents a minimum of eight hundred (800) minutes per credit per semester. The College operates on a 16-week on a semester system. Courses in the summer are offered as sessions varying from five (5) to ten (10) weeks length.\nDropping and Adding Course(s)\nStudents who drop course(s) must complete a Drop/Add Form with proper signature(s) required and submit it to the Office of the Registrar by the Drop/Add Date Deadline (See “Academic Calendar”). Students who fail to fill out the appropriate form and/or stop attending classes will receive an “F” grade. A student who properly drops a course will receive a “W” grade on his/her record. “W” grades do not affect the student’s GPA.\nThe student may drop courses by completing a Drop/Add form available from the Registrar’s Office or the respective site.\nThe Drop/Add form must be signed by the instructor of the class and the student’s advisor. Completed Drop/Add forms must be returned to the Office of the Registrar or to the respective Sites for processing by the drop/add date deadline.\n(See Academic Calendar.)\nA course dropped in the first two weeks of the semester will not appear on a student’s transcript.\nA grade of “W” will be recorded for all classes dropped beginning the third week of the semester.\nResidential students dropping below 12 credit hours at any time during a semester lose eligibility for campus housing. Any appeals to this must be submitted to Residence Life.\nStudents receiving financial aid must check with the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships for continued financial aid eligibility.\nAny student who discontinues a course at any time without officially dropping the course is subject to a grade of “F.”\nEnrollment Status\nThe number of credit hours carried per semester indicates a student’s enrollment status.\nFull Time\n—a student carries 12 or more credits per semester and must complete 24 credits in an academic year.\nThree-quarter time\n—a student carries 9-11 credits per semester and must complete 18 credits in an academic year.\nHalf-time\n—a student carries 6-8 credits per semester and must complete 12 hours in an academic year.\nPart-time\n— a student carries 5 or less credits per semester and must complete credits in an academic year.\nStudent who have earned fewer than 32 credit hours are classified as freshman.

No grade report or transcript will be issued to the student until obligations are satisfied in full.\nInstructor Drop\nStudents may be dropped from the course by the faculty. Instructor drop forms must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar for processing. Any student dropped by the faculty will be notified of the action by the Office of the Registrar. A student who wishes to be reinstated in a course from which they have been dropped must receive permission from the faculty and the Dean of School. If the drop is revoked, the student will be responsible for payment of tuition.\nFaculty/Biological Child Instructional Policy\nNote: All faculty are strongly advised to council his/her first-degree family member to take a class with another faculty as an option to this policy in order to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest.\nIt is Diné College academic policy that a faculty may provide instructional family member with the understanding that faculty members are ethically required to treat all students equally when dispensing scheduled professional instructions. Faculty and student have a responsibility to disclose the scenario to the relevant School Dean and the Office of the Registrar. The faculty member will provide a course grade accordingly for inclusion as other scheduled instructional reporting. A School Dean monitoring arrangement may be implemented, if needed and requested by the faculty. Conversely, a first-degree family member instructional arrangement is a routine, normal student teaching, learning protocol, and applicable academic policy and procedures prevail.",
    "Grades": "General Grade Appeal\nGrades are determined solely by the individual faculty who taught the course for the session(s) or the semester(s). A student who wishes to contest a grade must first attempt to resolve the matter with the course faculty.\nIf the matter cannot be resolved with the instructor, the student may appeal to the appropriate Dean of School. The student must provide the evidence as to why the grade posted by the faculty is an error. if the matter is not resolved with the Dean of School, the student may appeal a final time to the Academic Standards Committee. The decision of the Academic Standards committee is final.\nGrades may be appealed within one academic year. The Grade Appeal Form can be obtained by Office of the Registrar and will guide students through each of the three steps.\nGrade Point Average (GPA) System\nGrade Point Average (GPA) refers to the average grade at any particular time during, or at the end of, any particular semester. It is determined by the total number of Quality Points Earned (QPE) divided by total number of credits.\nThe Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) is the average for all courses taken at the college. It is computed by taking the sum of all Quality Points Earned (QPE) while in attendance at Diné College divided by the sum of all eligible credit hours earned.\nQuality points are figured as follows: A = 4 quality points, B = 3 quality points, C = 2 quality points, D = 1 quality point, and F = 0. For instance, if a student receives an A in ENG 101 (3 credits x 4 quality points = 12 QPE), B in MTH 106 (3 credits x 3 quality points = 9 QPE), and C in PSY 111 (3 credits x 2 quality points = 6 QPE), that person’s GPA would be 3.00 (27 total quality points divided by 9 credits = 3.00).\nThe following rules are considered in computing the CGPA:\nCourses that are repeated are counted only once for credit and the CGPA; however, all repeated courses appear on the student’s transcript.\nThe higher grade is used for computing the CGPA whenever a course is repeated.\nCertain courses can be repeated for credit and therefore are exempt from the two rules above (e.g., 099, 199, and 299 courses; students should consult with their advisor).\nWhen grades of “I” or “IP” have been changed to letter grades, they are computed in the CGPA.\nA “CR” grade is computed in the total credit hours earned, but is not included in the CGPA.\nIndividual instructors or academic divisions have specific policies and requirements for the “IP” grade. Students are advised to check each course syllabus carefully to be informed about the “IP” grade policy for courses.\nF, a failing grade, is shown on the transcript and computed in the CGPA unless the student retakes the course and passes, at which time the passing grade is entered on the transcript and the quality points are computed in the CGPA and the semester GPA.\nMidterm and Final Grade Report\nThe midterm examinations occur during the 8th week of classes during the Fall and Spring semesters. Midterm grades are not entered on the permanent record. Final examinations are scheduled at the end of the semester and must be taken during scheduled times.\nRepeating Courses\nStudents may repeat courses previously taken at the College to better their understanding or to improve their grades. A transcript shows that the course was repeated, but only the higher grade is used to compute the student’s CGPA). Repeating or retaking a class can affect a student’s financial aid. (Please see repeat or retake in Financial Aid Policies.",

    "Student Rights and Responsibilities": "All Diné College students have rights and responsibilities identified in the Student Code of Conduct Handbook. A copy may be obtained from any Diné College site or online at www.dinecollege.edu.\nTranscripts\nStudents may request an official transcript from the Office of the Registrar from the main campus in Tsaile or go to www.studentclearinghouse.org. All financial obligations to the College must be met before official transcripts will be released. Exceptions can be made for scholarships (including ONNSFA) with review. Unofficial transcripts can be printed at any time during a student’s enrollment period in Warrior Web (log-in required). Allow 2 days maximum for official transcript printing and/or processing.\nThe Transcript Request Form is available at all sites and on the College website. A fee is required for each Official Transcript. Currently enrolled students may review their unofficial transcript at any time by logging onto Warrior Web.\nTransfer Credits\nTransfer of credits is awarded for coursework completed at other colleges and universities.

Withdrawal forms must be returned to the Registrar’s Office with all the required signatures.\nParticipation in College-Sponsored Events\nParticipation in official college events or activities, such as intramural sports or conference attendance, requires satisfactory academic standing with a 2.00 GPA and a completed Class Release Form must be turned into the Office of the Registrar prior to departure.\nPlagiarism Policy:\nDiné College adheres to the highest standards regarding plagiarism. The College holds that it is ultimately the discretion of faculty to determine when a violation of the academic dishonesty policy has occurred. The definition of plagiarism includes but is not limited to:\n(1) “Self-plagiarism,” which includes a student reusing significant, identical, or nearly identical portions of his or her own work without acknowledging that one is doing so or without citing the original work: (2) the use of purchased reports or other material represented as the student’s work: (3) the use, by paraphrase or direct quotation, of the published or unpublished work of another person without full and clear attribution: and (4) the unattributed use of materials prepared by another person or agency engaged in the selling of term papers or other academic materials.\nStudents are encouraged to review the plagiarism policy and may challenge their final grade through the grade appeals process through the Academic Standards Committee. In short, plagiarism is the representation of another authors’ work as your own work. Intent is not relevant to determining if an act of plagiarism has occurred. All faculty members are required to state the Diné College plagiarism policy in their syllabus. In short, faculty members have full discretion to exercise their best judgement in terms of determining whether an act of plagiarism has occurred. Diné College does subscribe to a plagiarism detection service and all. Faculty members are encouraged to utilize this service if they require written papers in their courses. Faculty members are advised, though not required, to carry out sanctions in cases where more than 15% of a student’s content is plagiarized from in alternate sources. Faculty members should consult with their colleagues on best practices.\nFaculty members, at their own discretion, are free to carry out the most severe sanction in response to determinations of plagiarism. Each school is encouraged to develop its own norms of practice consistent with their academic discipline. Typically, the most severe remedy, in the case of a first offense, is to drop the student from class and assign a final grade of F. That said, faculty members are encouraged to discuss remedies with their colleagues in pursuit of less severe remedies.\nRegarding serial plagiarists, it is at the discretion of faculty members to maintain a written log describing incidences of plagiarism and the evidence against violators on a case-by-case basis. Files should contain a description of the violation and supporting evidence. These logs will be housed with the Dean of the pertinent school as well as with the office of the registrar (via Jenzabar notepad). The plagiarism file will only be revisited should a student violate the academic dishonesty policy a second time. Ideally, a student will acknowledge his or her mistake and learn from it swiftly without repetition. In other circumstances, it will be clear that a student is a serial plagiarist and subject to disciplinary action up to and including expulsion from Diné College.\nFor details on student appeals process, please refer to the student code of conduct and the faculty handbook.\nSatisfactory Academic Progress Policy (SAP)\nThe Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy delineates requirements for satisfactory academic progress as well as guidelines for academic probation and academic suspension. They are:\nFull-time students are placed on academic probation if, upon completion of 12 or more semester credit hours, they have a semester grade point average less than a “C” (2.0). If a student’s number of semester credit hours drops below 12 as a result of an IP grade, the student is still considered to be making satisfactory progress.\nPart-time students who have accumulated 16 or more semester credit hours are placed on academic probation whenever a total of 11 or less semester credit hours of work have been attempted and a cumulative grade point average less than a “C” (2.0) or is earned.\nThe Satisfactory Progress Policy applies to part-time students who have not yet accumulated a minimum of 16 semester credit hours.\nStudents on academic probation may take no more than 12 credit hours per semester.\nStudents placed on academic probation or academic suspensions are subject to additional regulations regarding SAP.\nStudents should contact the Financial Aid Office for pertinent Financial Aid (SAP) regulations.",

In addition, BOK Financial will serve as an \ninvestment f iduciary to our plan.  This additional oversight ensures that \nsomeone is continuously monitoring the funds in our plan to make sure \nthey continue to meet both performance and cost guidelines.  \nBOK Financial  is a recognized leader in the retirement services industry.  \nIt is known for its exceptional  service, communications, and competitive \ninvest ment offerings .  We are confident that you will be pleased with this \nchange.  \nBOK Financial will serve as investment advisor , record keeper, and \ncustodian of the Diné College Governmental Retirement Plan.  The \ntransition to BOK Financial will begin on March 25 , 2021 and will be \nfully completed during the week of April 19 , 2021 . \nOn the pages that follow, you will find important information about the \ntransition to BOK Financial .  Please review this information carefully.  You \nshould pay particular attention to the transition timeline  (see “ When \nchanges will happen ” on page 2) , since there will be a brief period during \nwhich you will not be able to access your account or make any plan \nchanges.  \nNow may also be a good time to review your investment strategy.  Inside, \nyou will  find information about your new investment choices as well as  how \nyour current investments with Principal Financial Group will be handled.  \nWe anticipate a smooth transition.  However, we understand that you may \nhave questions .  This noti ce should answer most of them and you can also \ncontact a BOK Financial Part icipant Services Representative at \n1.800.876.9557.    \nAs part of our new services, BOK Financial will be  conducting a \nnumber of virtual employee meetings  regarding the new features and \nservices that will be offered.   Human Resources will be providing you \nwith information regarding the specific dates  and times of the upcoming \n401(k) meetings.   \nPage | 2  \n What you can expect  \nTo facilitate the transition from one 401(k) carrier to the next, it is necessary to temporarily restrict plan account activity.  This \nis referred to as a freeze period  and is detailed below.  However, please note that your contributions to the plan will continue \nthroughout this period as scheduled.   During the Plan transition to BOK Financial, your existing account balances will \nautomatically be transferred into the new Funds that most closely resemble your current holdings.  For example, if you are \ncurrently invested in the Principal Large Cap S&P 500 Index Separate Account , your balance will automatically be transferred \ninto the Fidelity  500 Index Fund.  In addition, if you are invested in a Principal LifeTime Hybrid Target Date Fund, you will \nautomatically be transferred into the new Vanguard Instl Target Retirement Fund based on your birth year (see pages  3 and \n4 for complete Investment Mapping Chart s). \n \nFreeze Period  \nAs part of the conversion process, it will be necessary to suspend account activity within the Plan for a short period of tim e.  \nThis is referred to as a freeze period, and will impact access to your existing account as follows:  \n \nThe freeze period for your existing account with Principal Financial Group  will begin March 25 , 2021.  After that time, \nyou will be unable to make any changes to your existing account balance, including investment changes and withdrawal \nrequests of any type.   \n \nFor this reason, it is very important that you review and consider the appropriateness of your  current investments.  For your \nlong-term retirement security, you should give careful consideration to the importance of a well -balanced and diversified \ninvestment portfolio, taking into account all your assets, income and investments.  This notice is to provide you with sufficient \ntime before the freeze period begins . \nWhat you need to do  \nWhile you are not required to take any action regarding your Plan account at this time, it may be worthwhile for you to r eview \nthe appropriateness  of your cur rent investm ent options before 2 :00 pm Mountain time on March 25 , 2021 (the last day to \ninitiate transactions) .  If you decide to initiate a transaction before the freeze period , call Principal Financial Group at \n1.800 .547.7754 or go to the Principal Financial Group website at www. principal .com . \nWhen changes will happen \nThe timeline below presents a detailed look at what will happen during the freeze  period and the transfer of your Plan to BOK \nFinancial.  \nMarch 2 5, 2021  FREEZE  PERIOD BEGINS AT 2:00 PM MOUNTAIN  TIME  \nThis is the last day you can request a withdrawal or distribution, change the amount you contribute, \nor change your existing investment mix .  This means that even if one or more of your selected \ninvestment options experience a significant price fluctuation in either direction, you will not have \naccess to your account until the transition is complete.  To make these changes before the \ndeadline on M arch 2 5th at 2 pm Mountain time, call Principal Financial Group at 1.800. 547.7754 or \ngo to www. principal .com.  \n \nApril 13 , 2021 ACCOUNT BALANCES TRANSFERRED  \nYour existing account balance is automatically moved into your new investment options  (see the \nchart s on the next two page s).  There is also a chart that details the entire list of investment \noptions available in  your Plan  once the freeze period ends .   \nWeek beginning  April \n19, 2021 FREEZE  PERIOD ENDS  \nAll services available:  You now have full access to your account and all of the investment \noptions and services .  Visit www.startright.bokf .com  or for personal assistance call a Participant \nServices Representative at 1.800.876.9557 to review your account.  Your initial User name is your \nSocial Security number and your initial password is the last 4 digits of your Social Security \nnumber and the las t 2 digits of your year of birth.  \n \n \n \n Page | 3  \n Remember : You do not  have to do anything before your account is transferred to BOK Financial.  However , if you do want to \nmake changes,  review the above dates carefully.  The freeze period end date is an estimated date that is based on prior \nexperience and should not be considered as a guaranteed date since the conversion for your Plan could differ from prior \nexperience.   As stated previously, ongoing Contributions to the P lan will not be affected by the transition . \n \nInvestment Mapping Chart  \nTo facilitate the transition , Principal Financial Group will liquidate all Plan assets and transfer them to BOK Financial  except \nfor the Princ ipal Real Estate Inv U .S. Property Separate A ccount (see botto m of page 4).   \nThe chart s below indicate how your account balance will b e invested upon transferring to BOK Financial .  \nFirst, a ll assets currently invested in th e Principal LifeTime Hybrid Target Date Funds will be  automatically invested into the \ncorresponding Vanguard Instl Target Retirement Date Fund that is designated for your projected retirement date,  based on \nyour date of birth.  \n \nThe Vanguard Target Retirement Funds seek to provide growth of capital and current income consistent wit h its current \nasset allocation.

    "data\\hr_policies\\ferpa-and-confidentiality-35152.pdf": "FERPA & Confidentiality \nQuestion: How is FERPA to be applied where the Regulations direct that the parties be \ngiven all the particulars and evidence related to the investigation including information \nabout \nthe outcome which may include disciplinary action taken against the respondent. \nMinimally, the required disclosures involve providing the names of other student \nwitnesses in addition to the names as the complainant and respondent and student \nstatements collected. Typically, information considered to be a student record of one \nstudent is not permissibly shared (absent consent) with another student. An exception \nmight be disclosure to a complainant of information necessary to carry out a remedy \n(i.e. advising complainant of a no contact order in place prohibiting responding from \ncontacting the complainant, information regarding change in the respondent's schedule \nor bus). While the Regulations strive for transparency in this process, it unclear how to \nbalance the competing interests of maintaining requested confidentiality and \ncompliance with FERPA and providing equal rights to the respondent and compliance \nwith directives for full disclosure related to investigations and the related \nreports/decisions . \nAnswer: In the Rule, the Department discusses at length the intersection between this \nTitle IX Rule and FERPA. The Rule is interpreted to be consistent with FERPA, and both \nTitle IX and FERPA are interpreted to be consistent with constitutional due process. The \nDepartment states on page 1443 that the \"Department is precluded from administering, \nenforcing, and interpreting statutes, including Title IX and FERPA, in a manner that \nwould require a recipient to deny the parties, including employee-respondents, their \nconstitutional right to due process because the Department, as an agency of the Federal \ngovernment, is subject to the U.S. Constitution. The Department's position is consistent \nwith the principle articulated in the Department's 2001 Guidance that the 'rights \nestablished under Title IX must be interpreted consistent with any federally guaranteed \ndue process rights involved in a complaint proceeding.\"' Please see the \"Section 106.6(e) \nFERPA\" subsection of the \"Clarifying Amendments to Existing Regulations\" section of \nthe Rule, at pp. 1442-1508. \nQuestion: The regulations make the release of \na perpetrator's identity confidential \nunless FERPA exceptions apply. Based on the crimes of violence exception, that means \nthat sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and stalking outcomes can be released if there is a finding of violation, but there is no exception for sexual \nharassment. Does that mean that recipients cannot release a finding of sexual \nharassment through a reference check, because it would be retaliatory to release this \nconfidential information? Assume no state law requires such release. \nAnswer: The Title IX Rule, § 106.71(a), states that a recipient must keep confidential the \nidentity of any person who has reported sexual harassment, or who has been reported \nto be a perpetrator of sexual harassment. The purpose of this provision is to prevent the \nschool from retaliating against anyone. This duty of confidentiality has three exceptions \nin§ 106.71(a): if disclosure is permitted under FERPA, if disclosure is required by law, \nor if disclosure is necessary to carry out the purposes of Title IX and its regulations, \nincluding to conduct a grievance process. \nA recipient's disclosure of the identity of a respondent cannot be made with a \nretaliatory purpose without violating § 106.71. If the disclosure is made by a recipient \nwithout falling into one of the three exceptions listed in § 106.71, OCR would view the \ndisclosure as potentially retaliatory and examine the facts and circumstances to \ndetermine whether the disclosure either (i) satisfied one of the three exceptions (for \nexample, the disclosure was necessary to carry out the purposes of Title IX), or (ii) was \nmade for a non-retaliatory purpose. \nQuestion: In the \"Supportive measures\" section, it is said that \"Keep supportive \nmeasures confidential to the extent that confidentiality does not impair schools' ability \nto provide supportive measures\" Question: I found this item quite confusing and hope \nif there is any example to help clarify its meaning. \nAnswer: In the Preamble to the Rule page 393 the Department explains: \nIf a complainant desires supportive measures, the recipient can, and should, \nkeep the complainant's identity confidential (including from the respondent), \nunless disclosing the complainant's identity is necessary to provide supportive \nmeasures for the complainant (e.g., where a no-contact order is appropriate and \nthe respondent would need to know the identity of the complainant in order to \ncomply with the no-contact order, or campus security is informed about the no­\ncontact order in order to help enforce its terms). \nQuestion: Inquiry regarding confidentiality of supportive measures and due process: 11Answer: Section 106.30 (defining 11supportive measures ) states (emphasis added): \n11The recipient must maintain as confidential any supportive measures provided to the \ncomplainant or respondent, to the extent that maintaining such confidentiality would \nnot impair the ability of the recipient to provide the supportive measures.\" The Rule \ndoes not permit a recipient to breach this duty of confidentiality for a reason other than \nwhen keeping the supportive measure confidential would 11impair the ability\" of the \nrecipient 11 to provide the supportive measure.\" In the preamble to the Rule at pages 392-\n93, for instance, the Department explains: \nA recipient1 s ability to offer supportive measures to a complainant, or to consider \nwhether to initiate a grievance process against a respondent, will be affected by \nwhether the report disclosed the identity of the complainant or respondent. In \norder for a recipient to provide supportive measures to a complainant, it is not \npossible for the complainant to remain anonymous because at least one school \nofficial ( e.g., the Title IX Coordinator) will need to know the complainant1 s \nidentity in order to offer and implement any supportive measures. Section 106.30 \ndefining 11supportive measures\" directs the recipient to maintain as confidential \nany supportive measures provided to either a complainant or a respondent, to \nthe extent that maintaining confidentiality does not impair the recipient's ability \nto provide the supportive measures. A complainant (or third party) who desires \nto report sexual harassment without disclosing the complainant's identity to \nanyone may do so, but the recipient will be unable to provide supportive \nmeasures in response to that report without knowing the complainant's identity. \nIf a complainant desires supportive measures, the recipient can, and should, \nkeep the complainant's identity confidential (including from the respondent), \nunless disclosing the complainant's identity is necessary to provide supportive \nmeasures for the complainant (e.g., where a no-contact order is appropriate and \nthe respondent would need to know the identity of the complainant in order to \ncomply with the no-contact order, or campus security is informed about the no­\ncontact order in order to help enforce its terms). \n(emphasis added). \nIf the school conducts a grievance process in response to a formal complaint, § 106.45 \ndoes not exempt the recipient from its obligation to keep supportive measures \nconfidential. That expectation is buttressed by the Department's discussion of revision \nto the record keeping provision, § 106.45(6 )(10), at page 1406 of the preamble to the \nRule: In response to commenters' concerns that this provision giving the parties access to \nrecords might contradict the requirement to keep supportive measures confidential, the \nDepartment has revised§ 106.45(b )(lO)(i) to remove the language making records \navailable to parties. Because the parties to a formal complaint receive written notice of \nthe allegations, the evidence directly related to the allegations, the investigative report, \nand the written determination (as well as having the right to inspect and review the \nrecording or transcript of a live hearing), the Department is persuaded that the parties' \nability to access records relevant to their own case is sufficiently ensured without the \nrisk that making records available to parties under proposed § 106.45(b)(10) would have \nresulted in disclosure to one party of the supportive measures (or remedies) provided to \nthe other party. \nWhile § 106.45 directs the recipient to objectively evaluate \"all relevant evidence -\nincluding both inculpatory and exculpatory evidence\" (§ 106.45(b )(l)(ii)) and to provide \nthe parties a copy of the \"evidence\" that is \"directly related to the allegations raised in a \nformal complaint\" for review and response (§ 106.45(b)(5)(vi)), any supportive \nmeasures provided to the complainant are not \"evidence\" that is \"directly related to the \nallegations\" and the duty to keep supportive measures confidential applies throughout \nthe grievance process. \nIn your example, the \"timeline\" that a respondent might wish to establish may consist \nof establishing when the school received notice of the alleged sexual harassment (e.g., \nwhen the incident was reported), combined with the fact that the Rule requires schools \n\"promptly\" to offer all complainants supportive measures which, under the Rule, may \ninclude academic coursework adjustments, without piercing the confidentiality of \nsupportive measures by disclosing the recipient's records regarding supportive \nmeasures requested by or provided to this complainant. \nSee also the \"Section 106.6(e) FERPA\" subsection of the \"Clarifying Amendments to \nExisting Regulations\" section of the preamble to the Rule (pages 1442- 1508) for \ndiscussion of FERPA and the Rule's requirement to disclose evidence \"directly related \nto the allegations\" to both parties during a grievance process. \nAs an additional note, the Rule does not grant respondents a general \"right to due \nprocess,\" but does give complainants and respondents the specific procedural rights \nenumerated throughout § 106.45, which rights are rooted in concepts of due process \nand fundamental fairness for the benefit of complainants, respondents, witnesses, and \nrecipients. See, e.g., Rule at pp. 82-83, FN 203: E.g., Association of Title IX Administrators (ATIXA), ATIXA Position Statement: \nWhy Colleges Are in the Business of Addressing Sexual Violence 3-4 (Feb. 17, \n2017) (acknowledging that due process has been denied in some recipients' Title \nIX proceedings but insisting that \"Title IX isn't the reason why due process is \nbeing compromised .... Due process is at risk because of the small pockets of \nadministrative corruption ... and because of the inadequate level of training \ncurrently afforded to administrators. College administrators need to know more \nabout sufficient due process protections and how to provide these protections in \npractice.\" ) (emphasis added). The Department agrees that recipients need to \nknow more about sufficient due process protections and what such protections \nneed to look like in practice, and this belief underlies the Department's approach \nto the§ 106.45 grievance process which prescribes specific procedural features \ninstead of simply directing recipients to provide due process protections, or be \nfair, for complainants and respondents. Edward N. Stoner II & John Wesley \nLowery, Navigating Past the \"Spirit Of Insubordination\": A Twenty-First \nCentury Model Student Conduct Code With a Model Hearing Script, 31 Journal \nof Coll. & Univ. L. 1, 10-11 (2004) (noting that the trend among colleges and \nuniversities has been to put into place written student disciplinary codes but, \nwhether an institution is public or private, a ''better practice\" is to describe in the \nwritten disciplinary code exactly what process will be followed rather than \nmaking broad statements about \"due process\" or \"fundamental fairness\"). The \nDepartment agrees that it is more instructive and effective for the Department to \ndescribe what procedures a process must follow, rather than leaving recipients to \ntranslate broad concepts like \"due process\" and \"fundamental fairness\" into Title \nIX sexual harassment grievance processes, and unlike the NPRM the final \nregulations do not reference ''due process\" but rather prescribe specific \nprocedural features that a grievance process must contain and apply. \nQuestion: I have a question regarding when the Title IX Coordinator signs the Formal \nComplaint: For example, assume the Title IX Coordinator signs the Formal Complaint \nto begin the grievance process because there are 2 (or 3) complaints of alleged sexual \nharassment, and the perpetrator is the same individual in all of 3 of these complaints. \nAssume that none of these three complainants wishes to take advantage of the Informal \nResolution Process or file a Formal Complaint and go through the grievance process. \nWhen the Title IX Coordinator signs the Formal Complaint to begin the process, is the \nTitle IX Coordinator allowed to share the names of the three Complainants with the Respondent? Or, do we have to get permission from the three Complainants? What is \nthe proper procedure in this matter? \nAnswer: Thank you for your question regarding OCR's new Title IX Regulations. All \nreferences and citations are to the official version of the Regulations published in the \nFederal Register available is here. A link to the unofficial version of the final \nRegulations is available here . \nWhen a formal complaint is signed by a Title IX Coordinator rather than filed by a \ncomplainant, the written notice of allegations in 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(6)(2) requires the \nrecipient to send both parties details about the allegations, including the identity of the \nparties if known, and thus, if the complainant's identity is known it must be disclosed \nin the written notice of allegations. However, if the complainant's identity is unknown \n(for example, where a third party has reported that a complainant was victimized by \nsexual harassment but does not reveal the complainant's identity, or a complainant has \nreported anonymously), then the grievance process may proceed if the Title IX \nCoordinator determines it is necessary to sign a formal complaint, even though the \nwritten notice of allegations does not include the complainant's identity.

Efforts to provide Indian preference must be documented. If Indian preference is not feasible, Diné College shall documents in writing the basis of its finding of infeasibility and \nmaintain the documentation in its files for three (3) years after the end of the program year during which the funds were expended.  \nContractors apply for eligibilit y for Indian preference shall submit the following:  \nA.

A statement that requires Diné College to submit a list of core crew employees, if \navailable, and the contractors are required to provide preference to the greatest extent \nfeasible by hiring qualified Indians in all positions. \nMethods of Providing Indian Preference  \nA. For purchases at of above the Mirco -Purchase Threshold, but below the Simplified \nAcquisition Threshold, Diné College shall seek maximum participation by Indian -DINÉ COLLEGE  \nPolicies & Procedures Manual  \n \n8 \n owned economic enterprises and shall to the extent available, refer to lists of qualified \nIndian supply sources. If no quotations are solicited or received from Indian-owned \neconomic enterprises, Diné College must include as part of its documentation a \nstatement explaining the reasons for lack of Indian participation. As an alternative, a Diné College solicitation may be unrestricted to allow both non-Indian and qualified Indian-owned economic enterprises or organizations to submit quotes and an award shall be made to the responsible and qualified Indian-owned economic enterprises or \norganizations with the lowest responsive quote, if the quote is within the range \nspecified in X Factor Chart shown in the attachment to this statement and within the maximum total contract price established for this project or activity. If no responsive quotation by a qualified Indian-owned economic enterprises or organizations is within \nthe range specified in the attached X Factor Chart, award shall be made to the \nresponsible source with the lowest quote. \nB. For sealed bids, Diné College prior to solicitation shall decide on the method it will use in applying Indian preference depending on the particular procurement. Diné College \nmay select any one of the methods below, as follows: \n1. Issue the solicitation unrestricted to allow both non -Indian and qualified Indian-\nowned economic enterprises or organizations to submit bids and award shall be made to the qualified Indian-owned economic enterprises or organizations with \nthe lowest responsive bid, if the bid is within the total maximum contract price \nestablished for the procurement and within the applicable range specified in the Attached X Factor Chart of the lowest non-Indian bid price; or \n2. Restrict the solicitation to qualified Indian -owned economic enterprises or \norganizations; or \n3. Use a two stage preference procedure, as follows:  \ni. Stage 1 . Invite or otherwise solic it Indian -owned economic enterprises to \nsubmit a statement of intent to respond to the bid announcement limited to Indian- owned economic enterprises.  \nii. S\ntage 2 . If responses are not received from more than one qualified \nIndian- owned economic enterprise, adve rtising for bids is open to all \nfirms.  \nC. For competitive proposals, Diné College prior to solicitation shall decide on the method \nit will use in applying Indian preference depending on the particular procurement. Diné DINÉ COLLEGE  \nPolicies & Procedures Manual  \n \n9 \n College may select any one of the method s below, as follows: \n1. Issue the solicitation unrestricted to allow both responsible non-Indian and \nresponsible Indian-owned economic enterprises or organizations to submit \nproposals and establish a percentage or number of points set aside for Indian prefere nce as one of the evaluating factors to consider other than price; or \n2. Restrict the solicitation to qualified Indian -owned economic enterprises or \norganizations; or \n3. Use a two -stage preference procedure, as follows: \ni. Stage 1 . Invite or otherwise solicit Indian-owned economic enterprises to \nsubmit a statement of intent to respond to the Request for Proposals limited to Indian -owned economic enterprises. \nii. S\ntage 2 . If responses are received from more than one qualified Indian-\nowned economic enterprise, advertise f or bids limited to Indian -owned \neconomic enterprises.  \nD. If Diné College selects a method of providing preference, in b. or c. above, that results \nin fewer than two responsible qualified organizations or enterprises submitting a \nstatement of intent, a bid or proposal to perform the contract at a reasonable cost, then Diné College shall: \n1. Re-advertise the contract using any of the methods described above at b. or c. for \nsealed bids and competitive proposals respectively; or \n2. Re-advertise the contract without limiting the solicitation for bids or proposals to \nIndian-owned economic enterprises or organizations. This method does not provide Indian preference. By selecting this method, Diné College has determined \nthat Indian preference is not feasible even after provi ding for Indian preference in \naccordance with 24 CFR 1000.52(a), i.e. no qualified Indian bidder(s) responded, \nor less than two of the bid(s) received from Indian bidders were approvable; or \n3. If one approvable bid or proposal is received, Diné College may request funding review and approval of the proposed contract and related justification and \nprocurement documentation in accordance with 2 CFR 200.320(f)(3). \nE. Monitoring and Remedies. Diné College shall monitor the implementation of Indian \npreference in its contracts, subcontracts, training, and employment, and take DINÉ COLLEGE  \nPolicies & Procedures Manual  \n \n10 \n appropriate remedial action to ensure compliance.  If no bids or offers are received from \nIndian organizations and enterprises, the lack of participation and any reasons known \nby Diné College for la ck of participation shall be documented in the procurement file. \nCertification Investigation  \nThe Diné College shall investigate Indian ownership arrangements beyond formal documents \nsubmitted by each entity if: \nA. The firm is newly formed or the firm has Indian ownership of less than 100 percent \n(100%);  \nB. There is previous or continuing  employer -employee relationship between or among \npresent owners;  \nC. A business which is not an Indian or Indian organization or Indian- owned economic \nenterprise has an interest i n the firm; \nD. The ownership of the firm has changed since documents have been submitted to Diné College.  \nAssistance to Small and Minority Businesses  \nAs required by 2 CFR 200.321, Diné  College must make good faith efforts to ensure those small \nbusinesses and minority -owned businesses, women’s business enterprises, and individuals or \nfirms located within or owned in substantial part by persons residing in the area of Diné College project  are used when possible. Such efforts shall include, but shall not be limited to:  \nA. Including such firms, when qualified, on solicitation mailing lists; \nB. Encouraging their participation through direct solicitation of bids or proposals \nwhenever they are potent ial sources;  \nC. Dividing total requirements, when economically feasible, into smaller tasks or \nquantities to permit maximum participation by such firms; \nD. Establishing delivery schedules, where the requirement permits, which encourage \nparticipation by such firms;  \nE. Using the services and assistance of the Small Business Administration;  \nF. Requiring prime contractors, when subcontracting is anticipated, to take the steps listed DINÉ COLLEGE  \nPolicies & Procedures Manual  \n \n11 \n in a. through e. above.  \nIV. ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS  \nCompetition Required Under 2 CFR 200.319  \nAll procurement transactions much be conducted in a manner providing full and open \ncompetition consistent with the standards of this section. In order to ensure objective contractor \nperformance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that dev elop or draft \nspecifications, requirements, statements of work, or invitations for bids or requests for proposals \nmust be excluded from competing for such procurements. Some of the situations considered to \nbe restrictive of competition include but are not limited to:  \nA. Approve or allow noncompetitive pricing practices between contractors or businesses or between affiliated companies; or  \nB. Grant noncompetitive award to consultants who have retainer contracts with Diné College; or  \nC. Allow organizational conflicts of interest; or  \nD. Specify only a “brand name” product but shall ask for a “brand name or an equal” \nproduct or describe the good or service needed to permit competition; or  \nE. Take or permit any other arbitrary action in the procurement process that undermines o r \neliminates the competition process.  \nResponsible Bidders or Offerors  \nNotwithstanding the need for competition, the Diné College shall make awards only to a \nresponsible bidder or offeror.  \nA. The Diné College shall, before the awarding of any contract, ensure that the bidder has \nthe sufficient technical, administrative, and financial capability to perform contract \nwork of the size and type involved, and within the time provided. \nB. The Diné College shall require documents showing the bidder’s technical, \nadministra tive, and financial resources (including but not limited to financial statements \nand business profiles), evidence of contractor integrity and compliance with public policy, record of past performance, and other documents which demonstrate to the \nsatisfacti on of the College the bidder’s capabilities. DINÉ COLLEGE  \nPolicies & Procedures Manual  \n \n12 \n C. The Diné College shall reject any bid or offer not satisfying the responsibility factors of \nthis section.  \nD. Before the contract award, Diné College shall review the list of Debarred Contractors at www.sam.gov. Din é College staff will document the date of the review in the \ndocumentation for the procurement. Diné College shall also make similar inquiries to other appropriate federal agencies and Navajo Nation offices to determine whether such bidder or offeror is listed as being disbarred or suspended. No contract shall be awarded \nto a person or firm who is on any such list. \nCooperative Purchasing \nDiné College may enter into State or tribal inter -governmental agreements to purchase or use \ncommon goods and services. The decision to use an inter- governmental agreement or conduct a \ndirect procurement shall be based on fostering greater economy and efficiency. If used, the inter-\ngovernmental agreement shall stipulate who is authorized to purchase on behalf of the participa ting parties and shall specify inspection, acceptance, termination, payment, and other \nrelevant terms and conditions. Diné College is encouraged to use Federal or State excess and \nsurplus property instead of purchasing new equipment and property whenever such use is \nfeasible and reduces project costs.  \nSpecifications and Scopes or Work  \nGeneral.  All specifications and scopes of work shall be drafted to promote overall economy for \nthe purposes intended and to encourage competition in satisfying the Diné College needs. Specifications and scopes of work shall be reviewed prior to solicitation to ensure that they are not unduly restrictive or represent unnecessary or duplicative items. Functional or performance specifications are preferred. Detailed product specif ications shall be avoided whenever possible. \nConsideration shall be given to consolidating or breaking out procurements to obtain a more economical purchase. For equipment purchases, a lease versus purchase analysis should be performed to determine the most economical form of procurement. \nLimitations.  \n The following specification and scope of work limitations shall be avoided: \ngeographic restrictions not mandated or encouraged by applicable Federal law (except for \narchitect -engineer contracts, which may include geographic location as a selection factor if \nadequate competition is available); unnecessary bonding or experience requirements; brand name \nspecifications (unless a written determination is made that only the identified item will satisfy the  \nDiné College needs); brand name or equal specifications (unless they list the minimum essential \ncharacteristics and standards to which the item must conform to satisfy its intended use). Nothing \nin this procurement policy shall preempt any State, tribal, or local licensing laws. Specifications DINÉ COLLEGE  \nPolicies & Procedures Manual  \n \n13 \n and scopes of work shall be scrutinized to ensure that organizational conflicts of interest do not \noccur (for example, having a consultant perform a study of Diné College computer needs and \nthen allowing that consultant to compete for the subsequent contract for the comput ers). \nV. PROCUREMENT METHODS  \nSelection of Method  \nWhen satisfying its needs by procurement, Diné College shall choose one of the following \nprocurement methods, based on the nature and anticipated dollar value of the total requirement. \nDiné College shall provid e a rationale in its supporting documentation as to why it selected that \nparticular method. \nMicro -Purchase Procedures  \nGeneral.  Procurement by micro -purchase is the acquisition of supplies or services, the aggregate \ndollar amount of which does not exceed the micro -purchase threshold (§200.67 Micro- purchase). \nAny procurement not exceeding $5,000 in aggregate may be conducted in accordance with the \nmicro -purchase procedures authorized in this section. Contract requirements shall not be \nartificially divided so as to constitute a micro -purchase under this section, except as may be \nreasonably necessary in instances where breaking out such procurements can be shown to result in more economical purchases.  \nIndian preference. Required. \nObtaining Quotes . To the extent practicable, Diné College will distribute micro purchases \nequitably among qualified suppliers. Micro-purchases may be awarded without soliciting competitive quotations if Diné College considers the price to be reasonable per 2 CFR 200.404. If Diné College does solicit quotes, they will be done by telephone, catalogue, fax, email, or any other method considered reasonable. Awards will only be made to responsive bidders possessing \nthe necessary experience and skills to meet the procurement needs. \nDocumentation. At a minimum, the documentation should include the history of the \nprocurement, including reason for method, selection of vendor, how price was determined, and \nan approved purchase order or contract will be kept for each procurement. Diné College will verify that selected vendors are not on the debarred list prior to purchase. Diné College will also \ninspect the goods or services prior to payment. \nSmall Purchase Procedures  \nGeneral.  Any procurement not exceeding $64,999 in aggregate may be c onducted in accordance DINÉ COLLEGE  \nPolicies & Procedures Manual  \n \n14 \n with the small purchase procedures authorized in this section. Contract requirements shall not be \nartificially divided so as to constitute a small purchase under this section (except as may be \nreasonably necessary to comply with Sect ion V of this Statement or in instances where breaking \nout such procurements can be shown to result in more economical purchases). \nIndian preference.  Required. \nObtaining Quotes. Diné College shall solicit price quotations by phone, letter, email, or other \ninformal procedure that allows participation by a reasonable number of competitive sources. When soliciting quotations, Diné College shall inform the sources solicited of the specific item \nbeing procured, the time by which quotations must be submitted, and the information required to be submitted with each quotation. Diné College shall obtain written quotations; however, the written quotation may be a confirmation of a previous oral quotation only if it is submitted \nwithin 10 days of the oral quotation by the due date for submitting quotations. The names, \naddresses, and telephone numbers of the offerors and persons contacted, and the date and amount of each quotation shall be recorded and maintained as a public record. \nCompetition.  \n Diné College shall attempt to obtain quotations from a minimum of two (preferably \nthree) qualified sources and document the procurement file with a justification whenever it has \nbeen unable to obtain at least two quotations. Solicitation of fewer than two sources is acceptable if Diné College has attempted but has been unable to obtain a sufficient number of quotations. \nThe sole quotation received may be accepted only in unusual circumstances (such as an \nemergency threatening public health and safety) and must be consistent with the requirements of \n2 CFR 200.320(b). \nAward based on price. For small purchases award is generally based on price and fixed \nspecifications taking into account the method of providing Indian, minority, women owned \nbusiness and Section 3 preferences. Awards will only be made to responsive bidders possessing \nthe necessary experience and skills to meet the procurement needs.  \nBlanket Purchase Agreements (BPA).  Once a BPA has been established, task or delivery orders \ncan be placed without further competition. BPAs m ay be used for a variety of expendable \nsupplies and services and are particularly attractive when the exact items, quantities and delivery \nrequirements are not known in advance. The process to setup a BPA will save Diné College time \nand money while making purchasing quicker and easier. Prior to following the small purchasing procedures established above, Diné College will have conducted an historical database on their re-occurring purchases. After obtaining an estimate on the volume or quantities of a list of \nproducts, Diné College will use that information to solicit quotes or discount rates from a number of vendors. By using the purchasing power of greater quantities, Diné College secures better DINÉ COLLEGE  \nPolicies & Procedures Manual  \n \n15 \n pricing. The maximum total value of the small purchase BPA is $64,999. \nDocumentation. At a minimum, the documentation should include the history of the \nprocurement, including reason for method, price determination for the goods/services, selection \nand rejection of vendors, and an approved purchase order or contract will be kept for each procurement. Diné College will verify that selected vendors are not on the debarred list prior to purchase. Proof of Indian preference must be included in all documentation. \nSealed Bidding Required if over $65,000, optional for lower dollar amounts \nConditions for Use. Contracts shall be awarded based on competitive sealed bidding if the \nfollowing conditions are present: a complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase description is available; two or more responsible bidders are willing and able to compete effectively for the work; the procurement lends itself to a firm fixed  price contract; and the \nselection of the successful bidder can be made principally on the basis of price. Sealed bidding is the preferred method for construction procurement. For professional services contracts, sealed bidding should not be used. \nSolicita t\nions and Receipt of Bids. \nA. Issuance and amendments . An invitation for bids shall be issued including \nspecifications and all contractual terms and conditions applicable to the procurement. \nAny amendments to the invitation shall be in writing, and if it is n ecessary to issue an \namendment within seven days of the bid opening, the bid opening shall be postponed \nuntil at least seven days after the issuance of the amendment. The invitation for bids \nshall state the time and place for both the receipt of bids and the public bid opening. All bids received shall be time -stamped but not opened and shall be stored in a secure place \nuntil bid opening. A bidder may withdraw its bid at any time prior to bid opening. \nB. I\nndian Preference. Diné College has several options to me et Indian preference \nrequirements under Section 7(b) of the Indian Self Determination Act. The decision of what particular option to use should be made well in advance of the solicitation process and based on the potential availability of Indian- owned firm s capable and willing to bid \nor propose on a particular contract. \n1. Diné College may develop and adopt policies and procedures in procurement activities consistent with the requirements of section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Act; or \n2. Diné College may restrict the solicitation to qualified Indian -owned economic DINÉ COLLEGE  \nPolicies & Procedures Manual  \n \n16 \n enterprises and Indian organizations if Diné College has a reasonable expectation \nof receiving at least two (2) bids; or \n3. If Diné College is not sure there are a sufficient number of Indian owned economic enterprises or organizations available or that they will receive at least two bids, Diné College may use a two stage preference procedure as follows:  \ni. Stage 1.  Invite or otherwise solicit from Indian-owned economic \nenterprises to submit a statement of intent to respond to the bid \nannouncement limited to Indian- owned economic enterprises.  \nii. S tage 2 . If responses are received from more than one qualified Indian-\nowned economic enterprise, advertise for bids limited to Indian-owned \neconomic enterprises.  \nC. B id Opening. Bids shall be opened publicly and in the presence of at least one witness. \nAn abstract of bids shall be recorded and made available for public inspection. \nD. Awa rd.  Award shall be made to the lowest responsive and responsible bidders provided \nin the invitation for bids by written notice to the successful bidder, as follows. \n1. R estricted solicitations. If the solicitation is restricted to Indian -owned e conomic \nenterprises and organizations, and two or more [or a greater number determined by Diné College and stated in the invitation] qualified Indian owned economic enterprises or organizations submit responsive and responsible bids, award shall \nbe made to  the qualified enterprise or organization with the lowest responsive bid. \nIf equal low bids are received, award shall be made by drawing lots or similar \nrandom method. If fewer than two responsive and responsible bids from qualified Indian¬ owned economic enterprises or organizations submit bids, Diné College \nshall evaluate its options to reject all bids, cancel the solicitation and re -advertise: \n1. using any of the procedures in III(D)(2)(b) above, or 2. inviting bids from non-\nIndian as well as Indian -owned economic enterprises and organizations with no \npreference given, or 3. Diné College may accept a single bid received from a responsible bidder, subject to funding approval. Funding approval will be \nrequested in unusual circumstances, such as if Diné Coll ege determines that, \nbased on a cost analysis, the bid price is fair and reasonable, and Diné College \ndetermines that the delay of re -advertising would subject the project to significant \nhigher construction costs. \n2. U\nnrestricted solicitations. If the solicitation is not restricted to Indian -owned DINÉ COLLEGE  \nPolicies & Procedures Manual  \n \n17 \n economic enterprises and organizations, award shall be made to the qualified \nIndian-owned economic enterprise or organization with the lowest responsive bid, \nif that bid is within the maximum total contract price established for the specific \nproject or activity being solicited, and the bid is within the range specified in the Attachment to this Statement. If no responsive bid by a qualified Indian-owned economic enterprise or organization is within this range, award s hall be made to \nthe lowest responsible, responsive bidder. \nE. Mistakes in Bids.  \n1. Correction or withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids may be permitted, where appropriate, before bid opening by written notice received in the office designated in the invitation for bids prior to the time set for bid opening. After bid \nopening, corrections in bids shall be permitted only if the bidder can show by \nclear and convincing evidence that a mistake of a nonjudgmental character was made, the nature of the mistake, and the bid price actually intended. A low bidder alleging a nonjudgmental mistake may be permitted to withdraw its bid if the \nmistake is clearly evident on the face of the bid document but the intended bid is \nclear or the bidder submits convincing evidence th at a mistake was made.  \n2. All decisions to allow correction or withdrawal of bid mistakes shall be supported by a written determination signed by the Contracting Officer. After bid opening, \nno changes in bid prices or other provisions of bids prejudicial to the interest of \nDiné College or fair competition shall be permitted.  \nF. Documentation. At a minimum, the documentation should include the history of the \nprocurement, including reason for method, selection and rejection of vendors, cost/price \nanalysis for the p roject, and an approved purchase order or contract will be kept for \neach procurement. In addition, sealed bid documentation will include proof the \nsolicitation was publicly offered, a copy of the bid packet, bid opening sheet, and evaluation. Diné College will verify that selected vendors are not on the debarred list \nprior to purchase. Proof of Indian preference and other preferences must be included in \nall documentation. \nCompetitive Proposals Required if over $65,000, optional for lower dollar amounts \nConditions for Use. Competitive proposals (including turnkey proposals for development) may \nbe used if there is an adequate method of evaluating technical proposals and where Diné College determines that conditions are not appropriate for the use of sealed bidding. An adequate number \nof qualified sources shall be solicited. DINÉ COLLEGE  \nPolicies & Procedures Manual  \n \n18 \n Solicitation.  \nA. General.  The request for proposals (RFP) may be restricted to qualified Indian-owned \neconomic enterprises and Indian organizations if Diné College has a reasonable \nexpectation of receiving offers from two or more such entities. Diné College shall solicit proposals from non-Indian as well as Indian-owned economic enterprises and Indian- organizations if: Diné College prefers not to restrict the RFP; or, an insufficient \nnumber of qualified Indian-owned economic enterprises or Indian organizations \nsatisfactorily respond to a restricted RFP; or, a single proposal is received but not \naccepted. A mechanism for fairly and thoroughly evaluating the technical and price proposals shall be established before the solicitation is issued and included in the RFP. Proposals shall be handled so as to prevent disclosure of the number of offerors, \nidentity of the offerors, and the contents of their proposals.  \nB. E\nvaluation Factors . The RFP shall clearl y identify the relative importance of price and \nother evaluation factors and sub factors, including the weight given to each technical \nfactor and sub factor. Diné College shall reserve 10% of the total number of available \nrating points in unrestricted solicitations for the provision of Indian preference in the \naward of contracts and subcontracts, and up to an additional 5% for evaluation of the offeror's statement regarding training and employment of Indians. The proposals shall be evaluated only on the criteria stated in the request for proposals. Diné College may, \nat their discretion, invite a certain number of the highest scoring proposals for an \ninterview with the Board or other persons designated by the Board before the contract is awarded.  \nNegotiations . \n In those situations, where deemed necessary, negotiations shall be conducted with \nofferors who submit proposals determined to have a reasonable chance of being selected for award, based on evaluation against the technical and price factors as specified i n the RFP. Such \nofferors shall be accorded fair and equal treatment with respect to any opportunity for negotiation and revision of proposals. The purpose of negotiations shall be to seek clarification with regard to and advise offerors of the deficiencies in both the technical and price aspects of \ntheir proposals so as to assure full understanding of and conformance to the solicitation \nrequirements. No offeror shall be provided information about any other offeror's proposal, and no offeror shall be assisted in bringing its proposal up to the level of any other proposal. Offerors shall not be directed to reduce their proposed prices to a specific amount in order to be \nconsidered for award. A common deadline shall be established for receipt of proposal revisions \nbased on negotiations. \nAward . A\nfter evaluation of proposal revisions, if any, the contract shall be awarded to the DINÉ COLLEGE  \nPolicies & Procedures Manual  \n \n19 \n responsible firm whose qualifications, price and other factors considered, are the most \nadvantageous to Diné College, provided that the price is within the maximum total contract price \nestablished for the specific project or activity. For solicitations restricted to qualified Indian -\nowned economic enterprises and Indian organizations, if two or more such entitie s submit \nacceptable proposals, award shall be made to the qualified Indian-owned economic enterprise or \nIndian organization with the best proposal, provided that the price is within the maximum total price established for the specific project or activity. If fewer than this number of Indian-owned \neconomic enterprises or Indian organizations submits acceptable proposals, Diné College shall reject all proposals and resolicit without restricting the RFP to qualified Indian -owned economic \nenterprises and Indian organizations. Diné College may accept the sole proposal received, subject to funding approval, in unusual circumstances, such as when Diné College determines \nthat the delays caused by resoliciting would cause higher costs, or where Diné College \ndetermine s that the proposal has a fair and reasonable price.  \nArchitect/Engineer Services. Architect/Engineer services in excess of the small purchase \nlimitation may be obtained by either the competitive proposals method or qualifications -based \nselection procedures, sealed bidding shall not be used to obtain architect/engineering services. Under qualifications- based selection procedures, competitors' qualifications are evaluated and \nthe most qualified competitor is selected, subject to the negotiation of f air and reasonable \ncompensation. These procedures shall not be used to purchase other types of services even \nthough architect- engineer firms are potential sources.  \nDocumentation. At a minimum, the documentation should include the history of the \nprocurement, including reason for method, selection and rejection of vendors, cost/price analysis \nfor the project, and an approved purchase order or contract will be kept for each procurement. In \naddition, competitive proposal documentation will include proof the sol icitation was publicly \noffered, a copy of the bid packet, evaluation factors, and the evaluation score for all proposers. If \nDiné College has chosen to interview proposers, information on determining who was interviewed and how those interviews were evaluated will also be included in the documentation. Diné College will verify that selected vendors are not on the debarred list prior to purchase. \nProof of Indian preference and all other preferences applied must be included in all \ndocumentation. \nNoncompetitiv e Proposals  \nConditions for use. Procurements shall be conducted competitively to the maximum extent \npossible. Procurement by noncompetitive proposals may be used only when the award of a contract is not feasible using small purchase procedures, sealed bids, or competitive proposals, and one of the following applies: DINÉ COLLEGE  \nPolicies & Procedures Manual  \n \n20 \n A. An emergency exists that seriously threatens the public health, welfare, or safety, or \nendangers property, or would otherwise cause serious injury to Diné College, as may \narise by reason of a fl ood, earthquake, epidemic, riot, equipment failure, or similar event. \nIn such cases, there must be an immediate and serious need for supplies, services, or \nconstruction such that the need cannot be met through any other procurement methods, and the emergen cy procurement shall be limited to those supplies, services, or \nconstruction necessary to meet the emergency; or  \nB. Only one source of supply is available, and the Contracting Officer so certifies in writing; or  \nC. After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate; or  \nD. Federal awarding agency specifically authorizes the use  \nJustification.  Each procurement based on noncompetitive proposals shall be supported by a \nwritten justification for using such procedures. The justification shall be approved in writing by the Contracting Officer.  \nPrice reasonableness.\n  The reasonableness of the price for all procurements based on \nnoncompetitive proposals shall be determined by performing a cost analysis. \nDocumentation. At a minimum, the documentation should include the history of the \nprocurement, including reason for method, selection and rejection of vendors, cost/price analysis \nfor the project, and an approved purchase order or contract will be kept for each procurement. In \naddition, noncompetitive procurements will detail the reason for the noncompetitive award. Diné \nCollege will verify that selected vendors are not on the debarred list prior to purchase. Proof of Indian preference must be included in all documentation. \nCancellation of Solicitations \nA. An invitation for bids, request for proposals, or other solicitation may be cancelled before \noffers are due if: Diné College no longer requires the supplies, services or construction; or, Diné College can no longer reasonably expect to fund the procurement; or, proposed amendments to the solicitation would be of such magnitude that a new solicitation would be desirable; or similar reasons.  \nB. A solicitation may be cancelled and all bids or proposals that have already been received may be rejected if: the s upplies, services, or construction are no longer required; or, \nambiguous or otherwise inadequate specifications were part of the solicitation; or, the DINÉ COLLEGE  \nPolicies & Procedures Manual  \n \n21 \n solicitation did not provide for consideration of all factors of significance to Diné \nCollege; or, prices  exceed available funds and it would not be appropriate to adjust \nquantities to come within available funds; or, there is reason to believe that bids or proposals may not have been independently arrived at in open competition, may have been collusive, or m ay have been submitted in bad faith; or, a condition for canceling a \nsolicitation and resolicit, as specified above, is met; or, for good cause of a similar nature when it is in the best interest of Diné College.  \nC. The reasons for cancellation shall be docum ented in the procurement file and the reasons \nfor cancellation and/or rejection shall be provided upon request to any offeror solicited. A \nnotice of cancellation shall be sent to all offerors solicited.  \nVI.

For construction or facility improvement contracts or subcontracts \nexceeding the Simplified Acquisition Threshold, Diné College may implement bonding \nrequirements different from the minimum federal requirements provided that other funding \nagencies have made a determination that the Federal interest is adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements must be as follows: \nA. A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The “bid \nguarantee” must consist of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or \nother negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder will, upon acceptance of the bid, execute such contractual d ocuments as may be required within the \ntime specified.  \nB. A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A “performance bond” is one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such contract. \nC.

POLICY STATEMENT \nThe following procedures relate to the processing of all cash disbursements, including payments \nto vendors Diné College promotes effective controls to ensure the protection of Diné College assets, accurate financial reporting and efficient use of Diné College resources.  \nII. PROCEDURES  \nRequisition  \nThe initial tool of the procurement system is the requisition. A requisition serves a dual purpose 1) it provides a clear and complete description of the Budget Manager’s need and 2) it transmits authority to the Finance and Accounting Department to expend Diné College funds based on budget availability. All Procurements will require a purchase requisition prior to procurement \napproval. \nEach Assistant to the Budget Manager will enter requisition information into the War rior Web \nsystem electronically. Approval is required at the appropriate approval levels for Requisitions \nand budget transfers. Requisitions cannot be used for salaries, wages, and benefits. If a \nrequisition is associated to a Travel Authorization, the Travel Authorization must be approved \nfirst. \nThe system will automatically check for budget availability. If budget availability is recognized, \nthe requisition will be processed to the next step. The requisition will go through the \nauthorization process and then a Purchase Order will be processed. Expenses will then be \nrecognized as encumbrances until the invoice is received. Once the invoice is received, the Purchase Order with the invoice becomes an Accounts Payable item.  \nAll Requisitions must include the complete 10 -digit account code to be charged. \nFUND  FUNCTION OBJECT \nXXX XXXX XXXX  \nCompleting a Purchase Requisition \nStep 1. Complete a Purchase Requisition through the Accounting System \n(Jenzabar)>Requistion Creation >Create Requistion or use the online PR at Warriorweb: \nhttps://warriorweb.dinecollege.edu/ICS/Faculty__Staff/Online -Purchase-\nRequisition/Home.jnz  DINÉ COLLEGE  \nPolicies & Procedures Manual  \n \n31 \n Requirements include: \n1.

DINÉ COLLEGE  \nPolicies & Procedures Manual  \n \n35 \n CAPITALIZATION POLICY \nI. PURPOSE  \nAll assets meeting the definition of a fixed asset or intangible fixed asset shall be considered a \nlong- term capital asset and shall be recorded in Diné College computerized fixed asset inventory \nsystem. Such assets shall be systematically and accurately recorded and properly classified as:  \nA. Office Furniture and Equipment \nB. Buildings and Structures \nC. Land and Land Improvement  \nD. Vehicles  \nE. Culture Center Collection  \nF. Building and structures, including building improvements and support structures \nG. Construction in Progress  \nThese categories are used for reporting cost and depreciation (or amortization) purposes. This \nwill be the responsibility of Finance and Accounting Department. \nII. PROCEDURES  \nAsset Valuation: All assets shall be  recorded at historical cost or, if cost is not readily \ndetermined, at estimated fair market value at receipt. Cost shall include applicable direct and \nancillary costs. All costs shall be documented, including methods and sources used to establish any esti mated costs.  \nA. Purchased Assets: The recording of purchased assets shall be made on the basis of actual costs, including all ancillary costs, based on vendor invoice or other supporting documentation. \nB. Constructed Assets: All direct costs (including loaded la bor and project management \ncosts) associated with the construction project shall be included in establishing a self-constructed asset valuation. \nC. Donated Assets: Fixed assets acquired by gift, donation, or payment of a nominal sum not \nreflective of the asset’s market value shall be assigned cost equal to the fair market value DINÉ COLLEGE  \nPolicies & Procedures Manual  \n \n36 \n at the time of acquisition.  \nCapitalization: For inventory purposes (to be maintained by the General Services Department), \nall capital assets classified as Equipment & Machinery and Furn iture & Fixtures with a cost \nequal to or greater than $5,000 and a useful life of greater than one year shall be tracked using \nthe Diné College’s fixed asset inventory system.  \nFor the Diné College’s financial reporting purposes, all capital assets, irrespective of asset \nclassification, meeting the following single item capitalization thresholds shall be capitalized and \ndepreciated by the Accounting Department:  \nA. General Equipment and Transportation Equipment (Vehicles, Heavy Equipment, Office \nEquipment, Computers, Trailers, Custodial Equipment, etc.) – Equal to or greater than \n$5,000. \nB. Furniture and Fixtures – Equal to or greater than $5,000. \nC. Real Property (Land Improvements, Buildings, or Building Improvements) – Equal to or \ngreater than $5,000. \nD. Infrastructure  (Roads, Streets, Parking Lots, Sidewalks, Streetlights, etc.) – Equal to or \ngreater than $15,000. \nComputer Software Cost Capitalization : Computer software costs, whether externally purchased \nor developed in-house, are considered Intangible Assets and shal l be capitalized if the total cost \nof the software equals or exceeds $5,000.00. Costs below this threshold should not be \ncapitalized. Accounting for intangible assets is similar to the accounting for fixed assets. Unlike \nall other fixed asset categories, t he term used for expensing intangible assets is amortization. \nAmortization expense has the same effect as depreciation expenses.  \nConstruction in Progress Capitalization (CIP):  A CIP asset reflects the cost of construction work \nundertaken but not yet completed (frequently capital budget items).  For construction in progress \nassets, no depreciation is recorded until the asset is placed in service.  \nWhen construction is completed, the asset should be reclassified as building, building \nimprovement, land improvement, or equipment and should be capitalized and depreciated. A \nproject is considered complete if it is 90% complete and is being used for its intended purpose. \nDepreciation/Amortization for Long- Term Assets : All capital assets (except for land, certai n land \nimprovements and construction in progress) identified in the capitalization policy must be depreciated/amortized using the following estimated useful lives: DINÉ COLLEGE  \nPolicies & Procedures Manual  \n \n37 \n Land Improvements  \nBuilding and Building Improvements  \nEquipment and Furnishing \nModular Building Vehicles  \nData Processing Equipment  \nLibrary Books  40 years  \n40 years  \n7-10 years  \n20 years  \n4 years  \n3 years  \n15 years  \nLease Reporting : Departments and Divisions that have any single lease with annual lease \npayments greater than $5,000 per year are required to provide a copy of the written lease agreement to the Finance and Accounting department.  This will aid in the determination of \nwhether a lease is an operating or capital lease.  It will be the responsibility of the Accounting \nDepartment to determine if th e lease is a capital lease and what amount to capitalize, depreciate \nand report in College’s financial report. \nRetention of Records: \n For each capital asset recorded in the College’s fixed asset inventory \nsystem, evidential information such as invoices, contracts, deeds, purchase orders, appraisals \nand/or methods used to estimate actual costs shall be maintained for audit purposes to support \nthe entries recorded.  This documentation should be kept in either a permanent folder or in \ncomputerized format and maintained until at least three years after the asset disposal.  \nDisposals and Retirement of Fixed Assets : No sale or disposition of an asset shall be made \nwithout prior approval of the Controller, Vice President of Administration & Finance, and President of t he College.  There shall be sufficient documentation to describe the disposition of \nfixed assets.

PURPOSE\nParticipant support costs are those costs paid to (or on behalf of) participants or trainees (not \nemployees) for participation in meetings, conferences, symposia, and workshops or other \ntraining activities, when there is a category for participant support costs in the award. \nRegistration fees, travel allowances, manuals and supplies, tuition and stipends may be regarded as participant support costs in this case. \nParticipant Support Costs…  \nA.Are identified specifically on National Science Foundation (NSF) awards.\nB.Are awarded by other sponsors such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and others\n(but not necessarily referred to as \"participant support costs\") and tend to be by program.\nC.Are usually allowable on federal grants.\nD.Are accounted for in separate su b budgets.\nE.Are budgeted for the full amount under the appropriate object code identified by thecollege Office of Finance and Accounting (the OFA) and the actual participant supportcost expenditures post to object codes created by OFA staff for specific NSF awards.\nF.Are often subject to special sponsor regulations\nG.Do not allow re-budgeting from the participant support cost category into other categorieswithout prior sponsor approval.\nH.May be exempt from facilities and administrative (F&A/Indirect) costs.\nI.Require the university to return any unexpended participant support costs to them.\nJ.Are associated with special programs that provide research experience for participants,such as Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) and Research Experiences for\nTeachers (RET) on National Science Foundation grants. Additional sponsor regulations:\nK.Do not allow participant support costs to be budgeted on REU and RET sub budgets to bespent on non- participant activities.\nL.Budget allocations cannot offset a deficit in the parent account.\nM.May allow an administrative allowance of 25% of the participant stipend support only.DINÉ COLLEGE  \nPolicies & Procedures Manual  \n113 Consistent with current College Financial Policies and Procedures and Grants Policies, the \nCollege Office of Finance and Accounting (OFA) staff will create the appropriate subaccounts to \nprocess NSF award participant support costs in compliance with the Federal Uniform Guidance \nand the NSF Allowability of Costs. \nRequired Training  \nParticipants support costs training is mandated for all College grant managers.  \nPolicy Adherence Failure  \nThe College is the primary award recipient with oversight accountability to the sponsor. As such, \nthe College may suspend the rights and privileges enjoyed by the Grant Manager and College \nStaff when they do not adhere to these Interim Participant Support Costs Policies and Procedures.  \nIf a Grant Manager fails to comply with these Interim Policies and Procedures, the College may suspend or withdraw proposal submission for the Grant Manager and may inactivate existing projects/grants in the accounting system. Further disregard may also lead to other disciplinary \nactions in accordance with College Grants Policies.  \nFailure to implement these Interim Policies and Procedures properly by College OFA staff can \nresult in disciplina ry actions in accordance with College Grants Policies and the College \nPersonnel Policies and Procedures Manual. \nII. PROCEDURES\nProcess Overview/Accounting for Participant Support Costs\nThe Grants Accountant within OFA will request through the appropriate OFA procedures a \nseparate subaccount for NSF awards with participant support costs and will set up the sub budget. \nThe Grants Accountant will request a separate subaccount for participant support costs for other \nfunding agencies when the sponsor requires speci al accountability.  \nParticipant support costs for REU and RET on NSF awards are set up in REU/RET sub accounts. \nREU/RET is noted first in the award title.  \nAppropriate indirect costs are charged by entering the appropriate indirect percentage.  \nThe Grants Accountant will review participant support costs at closing and work with Grant Managers and their departments to adjust for any discrepancies.  \nGrant Manager/Department Responsibilities  DINÉ COLLEGE  \nPolicies & Procedures Manual  \n114 A.Review award documents at set up, looking for wording similar to \"participant support\"\nor \"participant costs awarded\" to determine if this issue is applicable to your grant.\nB.Check the sponsor's regulations to see if any rules prohibit the university from applyingF&A (Indirect) costs to these charges.\nC.If a separate sub budget has not been set up and the sponsor does not allow the university\nto apply F&A costs to these charges or requires separate accountability for these costs,\nnotify the Grants Accountant and a separate sub account will be established.\nD.Monitor expenditures for appropriateness throughout the life of the grant.\nE.Work with the Grants Accountant at closeout.\nF.Obtain written sponsor approval for any rebudgeting into or out of the participant supportcost budget.DINÉ COLLEGE  \nPolicies & Procedures Manual  \n115 FORMS AND APPENDICES \nAdministration will create forms and operationalize the financial policies. This will be \nimplemented within the procedures and process manual with notification to the Board of Regents \nof any changes.

PURPOSE\nDiné  College must comply with the requirements of Title 2 CFR 200 Uniform Guidance in \nregards to the administrative requirements and principles for determining allowable costs \napplicable to the administration of Grant awards. \nDiné College’s financial managemen t system, in accordance with 200.302(b)(7), must include \nwritten procedures for determining the allowability of costs in accordance with Subpart E – Cost \nPrinciples.  Costs include allowable direct and allocable indirect costs.  \nII. DETERMINING ALLOWABLE COST\nAllowable costs are those that:  \nA.Are necessary and reasonable;\nB.Are allocable;\nC.Conform to any limitations or exclusions in the grant award;\nD.Consistent with policies and procedures;\nE.Follow accounting practices and standards;\nF.Treated consistently throughout the grant program;\nThe Controller and VP of Finance  and program directors are responsible for monitoring the \ngrant award and t hat all costs charged  to their program budgets are accurate. \nIII. DIRECT CO STS\nDirect cos ts are those costs t hat can be  identified s pecifically with a particular Federal aw ard or  \nother i nternally or  externally f unded act ivity, or  that can be  directly as signed t o such act ivities \nrelatively eas ily w ith a high de gree of a ccuracy. Whether a cost is considered Direct or Indirect \nis determined b y the  Federal pr ogram and  what it typically cons iders t o be a direct cos t versus  \nindirect costs. The Diné College should determine what costs it considers to be a direct cost or \nindirect cost and apply treatment of those costs consistently. \nIII. INDIRECT ( F&A) COSTS\nIndirect Facilities a nd Administration  (F&A)  costs a re incurred  for common  or joint objectives \nand not readily assignable or cannot be identifie d specifically with a particular project without \neffort disproportionate to the results achieved. DINÉ COLLEGE  \nPolicies & Procedures Manual  \n121 Typical examples  of indirect (F&A) costs for many nonprofit organizations may include \ndepreciation on buildings and equipment, the costs of operating and maintaining the office \nbuilding, and general administration and general expenses, such as the salaries and expenses of  \nexecutive officers, personnel administration, and accounting. \nIV. PIROR WRITTEN APPROVAL (PRIOR APPROVAL)\nWith respect to the items of costs listed in 2 CFR 200.407 that require prior approval, these costs \nare allowable without the prior approval to the extent that they comply with the general policies and principles of 2 CFR 200. \nIf Diné College is awarded other federal grants that do not specifically allow written prior \napproval, the reasonableness and allocability of certain items of costs may be difficult to determine, therefore, in order to avoid subsequent disallowance or dispute based on \nunreasonableness and unallocability, 200.407 of the Uniform Guidance lists items of costs that \nDiné College may seek prior approval in advance of the incurrence of the special or unusual costs.  \nV. ALLOWABLILITY OF SPECIFIC ITEMS OF COST\nSpecific items of costs commonly incurred in the administration of awards, what are considered allowable, unallowable, or costs that are generally unallowable, but with exceptions, are listed in Subpart E – Cost Principles: General Provisions for Selected Items of Costs from 200-420-\n200.475. In addition, Diné College should review guidance on items of costs it explicitly \ndisallows under the grants program, even when the items of costs may be allowed with prior approval. DINÉ COLLEGE  \nPolicies & Procedures Manual  \n122 APPENDIX IV: TIME& EFFORT REPORTING PROCESS FOR GRANT AND \nCONTRACTS  \nI. PURPOSE\nTo ensure federal grants provide documentation to substantiate payroll charges Payroll systems based on records accurately reflect the work performed and supported by a system of internal \ncontrols that provides assurances that charges are accurate; allowable and reasonable; and \nproperly allocated with in the objective of the grants and contracts. \nII. PROCEDURES\nDiné College uses a timesheet to certify effor t on a bi-weekly basis. Effort reporting is required \nfor all employees who have been paid fully or partially from a federal/sub -federal source, or have \ncost shared time on federal/sub -federal sources.  The Diné College timesheet must be certified by \nthe Pri ncipal Investigator of each federal sponsored project that the employee is paid or cost \nshared on. If the principal investigator does not have specific knowledge of the work performed by an employee, then the report should be certified by a direct supervisor who has the knowledge of work performed. These certifications are due every 2 weeks.  \nDiné College uses a third -party online payroll processing company (PayLogics) to pay its \nemployees on a bi- weekly basis.  \nThe Payroll department organizes the payroll da ta in a special accounting journal called a payroll \nregister or payroll journal. It gives the employer the information needed to record payroll for the \npay period. Other examples of payroll documentation include but not limited to:  \nA.Leave Request\nB.Timesheets\nC.Faculty Contracts\nD.Request for Personnel Account Change\nE.Correspondence\nTime and Effort Reporting Process and Procedure for Grants:  \nA.On a pay period ending date, each grant PI (Principle Investigator) will submit\nmanual timesheets for their employees to payroll@dinecollege.edu for their grant’spayroll expenditures.\n1.Requirements on manual timesheets:\ni.Hours worked for the pay period ending.DINÉ COLLEGE  \nPolicies & Procedures Manual  \n123 ii.Dates for pay period.\niii.Any leave is indicated, with leave slips attached\niv.

Viewing another person’s sexual activity, intimate body parts, or nakedness in a \nplace where that person would have a reasonable expectation of privacy, without \nthat person’s consent, and for the purpose of arousing or gratifying sexual  desire.  \nD. Retaliation  \nRetaliation prohibited under this Policy includes threats, coercion, or discrimination \nagainst  any individual  for the purpose  of interfering  with any right  or privilege  secured \nby this policy, or because the individual has made a report or complaint, testified, \nassisted, or participated or refused to participate in any manner in an investigation, \nproceeding, or hearing under this Policy.  \nIntimidation, threats, coe rcion, or discrimination, including charges against an \nindividual for violation of this Policy or any part of the Student Code of Conduct that \ndo not involve sex discrimination or sexual harassment, but arise out of the same facts \nor circumstances as a rep ort or complaint of sex discrimination, or a report or formal \ncomplaint  of sexual  harassment,  for the purpose  of interfering  with any right  or privilege \nsecured by this policy constitutes retaliation.  \nThe exercise of any rights protected under the First Amendment does not constitute \nretaliation.  Charging  an individual  with a violation  of this policy or  a Code  of Conduct \nviolation for making a materially false statement in bad faith in the course of a \nproceeding  under  this policy does  not constitute  retaliation.  However,  a determination \nregarding responsibility, alone, is not sufficient to conclude that any party made a \nmaterially false statement in bad faith.  \nII. Definitions  \n1. Consent  12  In order  to give effective  consent,  a person  must  be of legal  age. Consent  means  a voluntary \nand informed  agreement  to engage  in sexual  activity.  Consent  can be withdrawn  at any time. \nThe following  list details  situations  where  consent  is invalid.  Consent  can be given  by words \nor actions as long as those words or actions create mutually understandable permission \nregarding the scope of sexual activity.  \nA. A person  who is incapacitated,  unconscious,  or asleep  cannot  give valid consent.  A \nperson with an intellectual disability may not be able to give valid  consent.  \nB. Valid  past consent  does not imply  future  consent.  In other  words,  each instance  of sexual \nactivity is looked at separately to determine if there was consent by all parties.  \nC. Silence  or failure  to resist  does not imply  consent.  \n2. Force  \nAdditionally, the use of force or threats to obtain consent renders the consent  invalid. The \nuse of force  to cause  someone  to engage  in sexual  activity  is, by definition,  non-consensual \ncontact,  and is prohibited.  Force  may include  words,  conduct,  or appearance.  Force  includes \ncausing another’s intoxication or impairment through the use of degus or alcohol. Under \nthis policy force includes the use of any of the following:  \nA. Physical  Force  \nB. Coercion  – is to force  one to act based  on fear of harm  to self or others.  Means  of \ncoercion  may include,  but are not limited  to, pressure,  threats,  or emotional  intimidation.  \nC. Intimidation,  Implied  Threats  and/or  Threats  \n3. Incapacitation  \nIncapacitation is the inability, temporarily or permanently , to give consent, because the \nperson is mentally and/or physically helpless due to drug or alcohol consumption, either \nvoluntarily  or involuntarily,  or the person  is unconscious,  asleep,  or otherwise  unaware  that \nthe sexual activity is occurring. Some signs of incapacitation may include, but are not \nlimited  to, lack of control  over physical  movements  (e.g.,  stumbling,  falling  down),  lack of \nawareness of circumstances or surroundings, the inability to speak  or communicate orally, \nor the inability to comm unicate for any reason.  \nIII. Supportive  Measures  \nSupportive measures are non -disciplinary, non -punitive individualized services the College \noffers  victims  and the accused  as appropriate,  as reasonably  available,  and without  fee or charge \nbefore or after the filing of a Formal complaint or where no formal complaint has been filed. \nSuch measures are designed to provide equal access to the College’s education program or \nactivity without causing an unreasonable burden, including measures designed to protect the \nsafety of all parties or the College’s educational environment, or deter sexual harassment. \nSupportive measures may include counseling, extensions of deadlines or other course -related \nadjustments, modifications of work or class schedules, campus escort serv ices, mutual \nrestrictions on contact between the parties, changes in work or housing locations, leaves of \nabsence, increased security and monitoring of certain areas of the campus, and other similar \nmeasures. The College will maintain as confidential any s upportive measures provided to the \nvictim  or accused,  to the extent  that maintaining  such confidentiality  would  not impair  the ability \nof the College to provide the supportive measures. The Title IX Coordinator is responsible for \ncoordinating the effective  implementation of supportive measures.  \n1. Title  IX Coordinator(s)  13  Diné  College’s  Title  IX Coordinator : \n \nMs. Ashlyn Jim  \nOffice:  230A  NHC  Building  – Tsaile  Campus \nEmail:  asjim @dinecollege.edu  \nPhone:  (928)  724-6955 \nAny person may report sex discrimination, including  sexual harassment (whether or not the \nperson reporting is the person alleged to be the victim of conduct that could constitute sex \ndiscrimination  or sexual  harassment),  in person,  by mail,  by telephone,  or by electronic  mail, \nusing the contact information listed for these Title IX Coordinator, or by any other means \nthat results in the Title IX Coordinator receiving the person’s verbal or written report. Such \na report may be made at any time (including during non -business hours) by using the \ntelephone number or electronic mail address, or by mail to the office address, listed for the \nTitle IX Coordinator.  \nThe Title IX Coordinators are responsible for coordinating the College’s prevention of an d \nresponse to sexual harassment and sexual violence, as well as for addressing any questions \nor inquiries regarding how the College applies federal Title IX law and regulations.  The Title  \nIX Coordinators  have many  responsibilities  as part of their job of ensuring  the College \ncomplies with the law. The Title IX Coordinator has the primary responsibility for:  \nA. Receiving  reports  and Formal  Complaints  regarding  sexual  misconduct;  \nB. Signing a Formal Complaint where the victim is unwilling or unable to do so in cas es \nwhere  a formal  complaint  is necessary to  ensure  equal  access  to the College’s  program \nand activities;  \nC. Providing  information  to students  about  resources  and support  services  available;  \nD. Designation  of an Investigator  \nE. Issuing  supportive  measures;  \nF. Carrying out restorative remedies to Complainants when directed to do so upon \nconclusion of a hearing;  \nG. Overseeing  the processes  in this Policy  in a neutral  and impartial  fashion;  \n2. Investigator  \nThe Investigator is ordinarily a member of the  College’s Department of  Human Resources \nspecifically  trained  in sexual  misconduct  investigations  to conduct  a prompt,  thorough,  and \nfair investigation of any sexual misconduct complaint against a College faculty or staff \nmember, affiliate, or a non -affiliate.  \n3. Confidentiality  \nExampl es of individuals  who can offer  confidentiality:  \nA. Medical  providers  14  B. Lawyers  providing  legal  advice  \nC. Licensed  mental  health  counselors,  psychologists,  and social  workers  \nD. Pastoral  counselors  (e.g.,  priests  and other  clergy  members)  \nE. Local  rape crisis  centers  and other  confidential  community  resources  \nAs noted  above,  when  a victim  speaks  to an off-campus  individual  offering  confidentiality, \nthe College  may be unable  to conduct  an investigation  into the particular  incident  or pursue \ndisciplinary  action  against  the accused.  In those  circumstances,  confidential  counselors  and \nadvocates will still assist the victim in receiving other necessary protections and support, \nsuch as victim  advocacy  services,  academic  support  or campus  accommodations,  disability \nservices, health or mental health services, and changes to living, working, or course \nschedules ( i.e., “supportive measures”).  \nAt any time,  a victim  who initially  requests  confidentiality  may also decide  to file a Formal \nComplaint  with the Colle ge and/or  report  the incident  to campus  security,  law enforcement, \nand/or  State  Police.  In all cases  where  a victim  submits  a Formal  Complaint  to the College, \nthe College will investigate the allegations.  \nIf the College determines that the accused poses a serious and immediate threat to the \nCollege community, law enforcement may be called upon to issue a timely warning to the \ncommunity.  Any such warning  would  not include  the victim’s  name  or any information  that \nidentifies the victim.  \n4. Privacy  \nPrivacy cannot  be offered by a College employee who is unable to offer confidentiality due \nto their legal obligation to report known incidents of sexual assault or other crimes to the Title \nIX Coordinator.  Even College associates who cannot guarantee confidentiality wil l maintain \nyour privacy to the greatest extent possible.  The information you provide to a College  \nemployee  will be relayed  only as necessary  for the Title  IX Coordinator  to investigate and/or \nseek a resolution.  \n5. Accused  \nA person  accused  of sexual  misconduct  or another  violation  of this policy.  \n6. Victim  \nAn individual who is alleged to be the victim of conduct that could constitute sexual \nmisconduct or other activity that would constitute a violation of this policy.  \n7. Bystander  \nBystander includes any person who w itnesses or learns about sexual misconduct or another \nviolation of this policy who is not themselves the victim or person subjected to the sexual \nmisconduct.  \nBystanders are welcome and encouraged to report incidents of sexual misconduct that they \nhave witnessed or learned about.  If your friend is a victim of sexual misconduct, please \nencourage them to reach out for help.  \n8. Complainant  \nAn individual who submits a “Formal Complaint” alleging sexual misconduct or another \nviolation  of this policy whether  he or she is alleged  to be the victim  of such alleged  activity.  \n9. Respondent  15  A person  accused  in a “Formal  Complaint”  of sexual  misconduct  or another  violation  of this \npolicy.  \n10. Formal  Complaint  \nA document filed by a Complainant or signed by the Title IX Coordinator alleging sexual \nmisconduct  or another  violation  of this policy  against  a Respondent  and requesting  that the \nCollege investigate the allegation(s). At the time of filing a Formal Complaint, a \nComplainant must be participating in or atte mpting to participate in an education program \nor activity of the College.  A Formal Complaint may be filed with the designated Title IX \nCoordinator for the College location in  person,  by mail, or by electronic mail, by using the \nTitle  IX Coordinator  contact  information  listed  in this policy.  As used in this paragraph,  the \nphrase “document filed by a Complainant” means a document or electronic submission \n(such  as by electronic  mail or through  an online  portal  provided  by the College)  that contains \nthe Complainant’s  physical  or digital  signature,  or otherwise  indicates  that the Complainant \nis the person filing the formal complaint. Where the Title IX Coordinator signs a Formal \nComplaint, the Title IX Coordinator is not a Complainant or otherwise a party under this \npolicy.  \nIn instances where there exist allegations of sexual misconduct or another violation of this \npolicy against more than one Respondent or by more than one Complainant against one or \nmore Respondents, or by one party against the other party , the Title IX Coordinator may \nconsolidate Formal Complaints if the allegations of sexual misconduct or other violation \narise out of the same facts or circumstances.  \nIV. Scope  of this Policy  \nThe prohibitions and protections in this Policy apply to locations, events, and circumstances \nover which the College exercises substantial control over both the accused and the context in \nwhich  the alleged  sexual  misconduct  occurs  and also includes  any building  owned  or controlled \nby a student organization that the College  officially recognizes.  Consequently, this policy \napplies  to on and off-campus  activities  and electronic  and online  activities  so long as the alleged \nsexual misconduct took place on a location or in an event or circumstance over which the \nCollege exercises  substantial control.  \nV. Procedures  \nThese Procedures outlined below will be used to investigate and resolve all reports and \ncomplaints of sexual misconduct against Diné  College students, faculty and staff members, \naffiliates, and non -affiliates, as appropriate. For purposes of the College’s Sexual \nMisconduct/Title IX Policy and these Procedures, an “affiliate” includes, but is not limited to, \nvisiting scholars and post -doctoral fellows who are not otherwise classified as Diné College \nfaculty, staff, or students.  \nAll other  complaints  not covered  by this Policy  for discrimination  or harassment  against  faculty \nand staff members and students, including but not limited to those based on race, color, creed, \nreligion, ethnic origin, age, sex, disability, and sexual orientation, will be resolved using the \nCollege’s Complaint Procedures for Unlawful Discrimination or Harassment.  \n1. Rights  of the Parties  \nThese Procedures for the in vestigation, adjudication, and resolution of sexual misconduct \nreports and complaints brought against students, faculty, staff, affiliates and non - affiliates \nare designed  to be accessible,  prompt,  fair, and impartial.  Throughout  this process,  both the \nvictim and the accused:  \nA. To be treated  with respect,  dignity,  and sensitivity.  16  B. To receive  appropriate  supportive  measures  from  the College.  \nC. Privacy  to the extent  possible,  consistent  with applicable  law and College  policy.  \nD. Information  about  the College’s  Sexual  Misconduct/Title  IX Policy.  \nE. A prompt  and thorough  investigation  of the allegations.  \nF. Notification,  in writing,  of the case resolution,  including  the outcome  of any appeals.  \nG. A report  of the incident  to law enforcement  can be made  at any time.  \n2. Preliminary  Matters  \nA. Effect  of Criminal  Proceedings  \nThe filing  and processing  of a report  or complaint  of sexual  misconduct  is separate  from \nand independent  of any criminal  investigation  or proceeding.  Diné  College  will not wait \nfor the conclusion of any criminal investigation or proceedings to begin its own \ninvestigation, although the College may delay temporarily these procedures for good \ncause including a delay needed because of pending law enforcement activity. Neither \nlaw enforcement’s decision wh ether to prosecute an accused nor the outcome of a \ncriminal  prosecution  is determinative  of whether  sexual  misconduct  occurred  under  the \nCollege’s Sexual Misconduct/Title IX Policy.  \nB. Advisor  \nUpon the submission of a Formal Complaint, the Complainant and Res pondent may \neach choose to be accompanied to any interview, meeting or hearing related to these \nProcedures  by an Advisor,  who may provide  support  during  such interview,  meeting  or \nhearing.  During  meetings  and interviews,  the Advisor  may quietly  confer  or pass notes \nwith the party  in a non-disruptive  manner.  The Advisor  may not intervene  in a meeting \nor interview, or address the Investigator. Should the matter proceed to a hearing, both \nthe Respondent and Complainant will have the opportunity to present evi dence in \nhis/her defense and to inspect and review evidence be accompanied by an advisor of \nhis/her  choice.  If a Complainant  or Respondent  does not have  an Advisor  present  at the \nhearing, the College will provide an Advisor of the College’s choice without fee or \ncharge to that party.  Such Advisor may be, but is not required to be, an attorney.  \nC. Time  Frame  for Complaint  Resolution  \nThe College  will seek to resolve  every  report  of sexual  misconduct  within  forty -five \n(45) business days of the start of an investi gation, not counting any appeals. Time \nframes may vary depending on the complexity of a case and the availability of \nwitnesses,  and at certain  times  of the academic  year (for example,  during  breaks,  study \nperiods  or final exams).  The College  may extend  any time frame  for good  cause,  with a \nwritten explanation to the complainant and respondent.  \n3. Reporting  Misconduct  and Filing  a Formal  Complaint  \nA. Disclosing  to the Title  IX Coordinator  \nA victim  may wish  to tell someone  about  an incident  of sexual  misconduct  but isn’t yet \nsure whether he or she wishes to have official action taken against the individual who \ncommitted  it. Victims  have  the option  to report  (tell someone  about)  an incident  without \nbeing obligated to file a Formal Complaint. Whether a victim chooses to report or \nchooses  to formally file  a Formal  Complaint  about  an incident,  the victim  has the right \nto be protected by the College from retaliation and the right to receive assistance and \nresources (supportive measures) from the College.  17  It should be emphasized here that anyone can report sexual misconduct, even third \nparties and reports are not required to be in writing. However, if the victim is not \nidentified,  the College  will not be able to provide  supportive  measures.  The College  will \nmaintain  confidential  the identity  of any individual  who has made  a report  or submitted \na Formal  Complaint  of sexual  misconduct,  any accused  or Respondent,  and any witness, \nexcept as may be permitted by FERPA, or as required by law, or to carry out the \npurposes of the Title IX of the Civil Rights Act regulations, including the conduct of \nany investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding arising under those regulations. \nComplaints alleging retaliation may be filed according to the grievance procedures in  \nthis policy.  \nWhen  the Title  IX Coordinator  becomes  aware  of an incident  of sexual  misconduct,  the \nCoordinator  will promptly  contact  the victim  or other  reporting  individual  to discuss  the \navailability of supportive measures, consider the victim’s wishes with respect to \nsupportive measures, provide information of the availability of supportive measures \nwith or without the filing of a Formal Complaint, and explain the process for filing a \nFormal Complaint. The Title IX Coordinator is the person with whom a victim would \nfile a Formal Complaint regarding sexual misconduct, if the victim wishes to do so. \nUpon receiving a Formal Complaint, the Title IX Coordinator will designate an \nInvestigator to investigate the incident to determine whether the alleged conduct , if \nproven to be true, would constitute “sexual harassment” or “retaliation” as defined in \nthis policy or otherwise constitutes “prohibited behavior” in this policy. The \nInvestigator will also ensure that at the time of filing the Formal Complaint the vic tim \nis participating or attempting to participate in the College’s education program or \nactivity in the capacity as a student or employee, otherwise this policy does not apply \nto them.  \nIf the Investigator determines that the alleged conduct, if proven, doe s not constitute \n“sexual  harassment”  or “retaliation”  as defined  in this policy,  then the Investigator  will \nassess  whether  the conduct  constitutes  other  prohibited  behavior.  If the alleged  conduct \ndoes not constitute any “prohibited behavior,” the Investig ator will dismiss the \nComplaint.  If, however, the alleged conduct constitutes “prohibited behavior,” the \nInvestigator  will investigate and commence the appropriate College disciplinary process \nagainst the accused, if that individual is a student or employe e. The Title IX Coordinator \nwill also offer the victim supportive measures as defined in this policy.  \nVictims can also report sexual misconduct to the Title IX Coordinator even if they do \nnot want  an investigation  to occur.  Such  a report  can be submitted  anonymously  or not \nanonymously.  However,  if the victim  reports  anonymously,  the College  will not be able \nto provide  the victim  supportive  measures.  If the victim  reports  without  anonymity,  the \nTitle IX Coordinator will nevertheless maintain the confidentiality of any supportive \nmeasures  provided  to the victim  (and the accused  if such measures  are provided  to him \nor her) to the extent maintaining such confidentiality will not impair the ability of the \nCollege to provide such measures.  All victims who report sexual misconduct will \nreceive  supportive  measures  and instructions  on how to file a Formal  Complaint  should \nhe or she decide to do so. Although the Title IX Coordinator is not a confidential \nresource,  reporting  an incident  to the Title  IX Coord inator  while  expressing  one’s  wish \nfor no investigation to occur is known as a “confidential report” to the Title IX \nCoordinator.  In these cases, the Title IX Coordinator will first ask the victim’s \npermission before beginning an investigation and commencing the appropriate \ndisciplinary  process.  If the victim  declines  to give permission,  the Title  IX Coordinator \nwill honor  the victim’s  decision  and will not investigate  the report,  except  in 18  circumstances  where  failing  to investigate  would prevent  the College  from  providing  a \nsafe and non -discriminatory environment for all members of the College community. In \nthose cases, the Title IX Coordinator could file a Formal Complaint and commence an  \ninvestigation  and, if appropriate,  a disciplinary  process,  as well,  although  the victim \nwould  not be obligated  to participate  in the investigation  or the disciplinary  process.  In \ncases  where  the Title  IX Coordinator,  rather  than the victim,  files a Formal  Complaint, \nthe Coordinator will never theless treat the victim as a party to the process. Whatever \nthe victim decides, the Title IX Coordinator will still offer the student supportive \nmeasures.  \n4. Disclosing  to Someone  Other  than the Title  IX Coordinator  \nIncidents can also be disclosed to College  employees other than the Title IX Coordinator, if \nthe victim  prefers  to do so. College  employees  are required  to notify  the Title  IX Coordinator \nwhen an incident of sexual misconduct is disclosed to them, in order to protect the safety of \nother people on campus and so that the Title IX Coordinator can reach out to the victim to \noffer  help,  support,  and information  about  filing  a Formal  Complaint  if the victim  desires.  If \nthe victim  reports  the incident  to the College  associate  anonymously,  the College  will not be \nable to provide the victim supportive measures.  If the victim reports the incident to the \nCollege employee without anonymity, the Title IX Coordinator will nevertheless maintain \nthe confidentiality  of any supportive  measures  provided  to the victim  (and the accused  if such \nmeasures are provided to him or her) to the extent maintaining such confidentiality will not \nimpair the ability of the College to provide such measures.  The information disclosed will \nbe limited to only the information needed to co nduct  an investigation (if  the victim  permits) \nand to ensure victim safety.  \nIf the victim  does not report  anonymously,  upon  receiving  notice  of the report  of an incident \nby a College employee, the Title IX Coordinator will respond to the victim by offering  \nsupportive measures and ascertain whether the victim wishes to file a Formal Complaint.  \nVictims  can also disclose  incidents  to non-College  officials,  such as a local  rape crisis  center \nor a mental health counselor.  A list of some local rape crisis centers  and other community \nresources  is provided  in the Annual  Fire and Security  Report  found  on the College’s  website \nat pwwww.dinecollege.edu  These  types  of non-College  officials  provide  confidentiality  and \ncan offer  support  and referrals  to helpful  services  and resources.  These  persons  are not \naffiliated with  the College  and have  no obligation  to notify  the Title  IX Coordinator  about  the \nincident. Consequently, if the College is not informed of the incident, victims should not \nexpect the College  to investigate  the matter.  However,  the College  will investigate  allegations  \ncontained in a Formal Complaint with the College.  \n5. Submitting  a Report  or Formal  Complaint  Confidentially  and/or  Anonymously  \nIn addition to the option s described above in regard to privately or confidentially disclosing \nan incident of sexual misconduct, victims also have several options for making a Formal \nComplaint.  The Title  IX Coordinator  is the person  with whom  a student  would  file a Formal \nComplaint regarding sexual misconduct, if the victim wishes to do so.  Formal Complaints \ncan be made  to the Title  IX Coordinator  by submitting  a complaint  to the Title  IX Coordinator \nin-person, via email, or via the online incident report form.  \nAll reports  of sexual  misconduct  made  to all College  employees  will be handled  with privacy. \nThose  reporting  instances  of sexual  misconduct  – whether  they are  the victim,  an employee, \na friend, or a witness/bystander – can also make confidential and/or anonymous reports if \nthey prefer to do so.  \nA. Confidential  Reports  19  Reports  can be made  by informing  the Title  IX Coordinator  in person  or in writing  that \nyou do not want an investigation to occur.  \nWhile this reporting method is known as a “confidential report”, due to the nature of \ntheir responsibilities, the Title IX Coordinator is not truly a confidential resource.  As \nnoted above, all information provided will be handled with the utmost privacy.  \nWhen  a reporting  individual  reports  an incident  of sexual  misconduct  but expresses  that \nhe/she does not wish for the College to conduct an investigation, the College will \ntypically honor that request.  However, sometimes the College will be obligated to \nweigh  such a request  against  the College’s  duty to ensure  the safety  of others  on campus. \nSome of the factors the College may consider in weighing a request to not investigate \nmay include:  whether the accused has a history of violent behavior or is a repeat \noffender;  whether  the incident  represents  escalation  in unlawful  conduct  by the accused \nindividual;  the increased  risk that the accused  individual  will commit  additional  acts of \nviolence; whether the accused individual used a weapon and/or force; whether the \nreporting individual is a minor; and whether the inst itution possesses other means to \nobtain evidence (e.g., security footage) and whether available information reveals a \npattern of perpetration at a given location or by a particular group. If the Title IX \nCoordinator  determines  that a victim’s  confidentiality  cannot  be maintained  and that an \ninvestigation is necessary, the victim who reported the incident will be notified in \nwriting,  prior  to the start of an investigation  and will, to the extent  possible,  only share \ninformation with  the people  responsible  for handling  the College’s  response.  The Title \nCoordinator  will remain  ever mindful  of the  victim’s  well-being  and will take ongoing \nsteps  to protect  the victim  from  retaliation  or harm  and work  with the victim  to create  a \nsafety plan. Retaliation against the victim, whether by students or College employees, \nwill not be tolerated.  In these cases, should the Title IX Coordinator decide to \ncommence a disciplinary proceeding against the accused, the Coordinator will \nnevertheless treat the v ictim as a party to the process and offer the victim supportive \nmeasures.  \nB. Anonymous  Reports  \nThese reports can be made by not including your name or email address when \nsubmitting  the online  incident  report  form.  Individuals  who wish  to anonymously  report \nan incident should be aware that their anonymity may inhibit the College’s ability to \nconduct  a full investigation  of the incident,  provide  supportive  measures,  and/or  update \nthe victim regarding actions taken.  \nRegardless  of how a victim  chooses  to disclose  the alleged  misconduct,  the College  may not \nrequire a victim to participate in any investigation or disciplinary proceeding.  \nIn the event that sexual misconduct has been committed by a non -member of the College \ncommunity  (including  an unknown  person  or stranger),  victims  may still report  the incident \nto the College  and receive  supportive  measures  and protection.  For a list of on-campus  and \noff-campus resources and support services near you please contact the Department of \nHuman Resources.  \nVictims  also have  the option  to make  a report  to law enforcement,  either  in addition  to or as \nan alternative to making a report to the College.  \n6. Amnesty  Policy  for Alcohol  and/or  Drug  Use \nStudents  should  not be afraid  to report  an incident  of sexual  misconduct  merely  because  they \nwere  drinking  alcohol  or using  drugs  at the time of the incident,  whether  they were  a victim,  20  witness, or bystander.  Diné College has adopted an amnesty policy for alcohol and/or drug \nuse in regard  to incidents  of sexual  misconduct.  The health  and safety  of every  student  at the \nCollege is of utmost importance.  The College recognizes that students who have been \ndrinking and/or using drugs (whether such use is voluntary or involuntary) at the time that \nviolence, including  but not limited to domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, or sexual \nassault  occurs  may be  hesitant  to report  such incidents  due to fear of potential  consequences \nfor their own conduct.  The College  strongly  encourages  students  to report  domestic  violence, \ndating  violence,  stalking,  or sexual  assault  to College  employees.  A bystander  acting  in good \nfaith or a reporting individual acting in good faith that discloses any incident of domestic \nviolence, dating violence, stalking, or sexual assault to the College associates or law \nenforcement will not be subject to the College’s code of conduct action for violations of \nalcohol and/or drug use policies occurring at or near the time of the commission of the \ndomestic violence, dating violence, stalking, or sexual assa ult. \n7. Disclosures  During  Advocacy  Events  \nIndividuals occasionally disclose information regarding sexual misconduct during a public \nawareness and/or advocacy event, such as candlelight vigils, protests, survivor speak -outs, \nTake Back the Night events, Day of  Unity events, and other similar public events. These \nevents typically serve the purpose of empowering survivors and raising awareness about \nissues related to sexual violence, as opposed to serving as a forum in which an allegation of \nsexual misconduct is reported.  Accordingly, the College may not investigate allegations \ndisclosed at these events.  However, any individual always remains free to report such \nconduct with the College and the College will investigate all allegations in a Formal \nComplaint.  The Co llege may use information provided at such events to inform its efforts \nfor additional education and prevention efforts regarding sexual misconduct and sexual \nviolence.  \n8. Campus  Alerts  \nWhen  certain  crimes  occur  in certain  areas  on and/or  near campus  that represent  a serious  or \ncontinuing threat to the campus community, the College is obligated under federal law to \nissue a timely warning, in order to protect the safety of others. Crimes triggering a timely \nwarning might include, for example, a rapist  who is st ill present on campus.  When a timely \nwarning is issued, the warning will never identify any victims or reporting individuals. See \nthe College’s Annual Fire and Security Report for more information on the Campus \nEmergency Notification System. This report ca n be found on the College’s website at: \nhttps://www.dinecollege.edu . \n9. Campus  Crime  Data \nWhen  the Title  IX Coordinator  receives  reports  of sexual  misconduct  and certain  other  crimes \nthat occur  in certain  locations  on and/or  near campus,  federal  and State  laws require  the Title \nIX Coordinator to count the number of those reports for inclusion in the College’s Jeanne \nClery Campus and Security Survey and inclusion in the College’s Annual Fire and Security \nReport. This is merely an anonymous tally – neither the identity of the reporting individual \nnor the specifics of the crime are included in these reports.  \n10. Resources  and Protection  for Victims  \nDiné  College is committed to supporting victims and survivors of sexual misconduct and \nsexual  violence,  regardless  of when,  where,  or who committed  the acts in question.  If you or \na friend  need  help finding  resources,  the College  encourages  you to reach  out to your campus \nTitle IX Coordinator, who can help obtain those resources. If you aren’t sure who your \ncampus  Title  IX Coordinator  is, a list of all campus  Title  IX Coordinators  is provided  in this 21  policy.  If you are in immediate  danger  at any point,  call 911. \nA. Obtaining  Immediate  Medical  Attention  \nIf you have  been  the victim  of rape,  sexual  assault,  domestic  violence,  or dating  violence \nand are in need of  immediate medical attention, please call 911 and/or consider visiting \na hospital, urgent care center, or medical provider. Some State law requires that all \nhospitals in the State offer forensic rape examinations (sometimes also called ‘forensic \nsexual  assault examinations’  or simply  ‘rape  kits’).  Some  states  require  hospitals  to notify \nthe victim/survivor that they can choose to have the forensic rape exam and its related \ncharges billed to the Victim Services at no cost to the victim/survivor. After the ex am, \nyou might receive other medical services or counseling services for which the hospital \nmight  charge  you or bill your health  insurance;  if your insurance  plan is through  someone \nelse (such as your parent), you are encouraged to tell hospital staff if yo u do not want \nyour insurance policyholder to be notified about your access to these services.  \nEspecially  in incidents  of rape or sexual  assault,  it may be important  to receive  a forensic \nexamination  as soon  as possible  in order  to preserve  evidence  and/or  to receive  protection \nfrom sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy. To best preserve evidence, you \nshould  avoid  showering,  washing,  changing  clothes,  discarding  clothes,  combing  hair, or \notherwise altering your physical appearance until the exam is c omplete, and you should \nseek an exam as soon as possible. Even if you don’t want evidence to be collected, it is \nstill recommended  that you get examined  by a doctor  in order  to address  physical  injuries, \npotential  pregnancy,  and possible  exposure  to sexually  transmitted  infections.  For more \ninformation about what to do after an assault, visit the National Sexual Violence Resource \nCenter website at www.nsvrc.org.  \nMore information regarding forensic examinations and sexually transmitted infections, \nas well as other resources available through your campus Title IX Coordinator.  \nB. Provision  of Supportive  Measures  \nIn addition  to the above  on-campus  and off-campus  resources,  the College  is prepared  to \noffer all victims o f sexual misconduct, whether reported with or without a Formal \nComplaint, certain protections and reasonable campus accommodations.  These \naccommodations  are known  as “supportive  measures”  as defined  above  in this policy.  Of \ncourse, in cases where a victim chooses to report anonymously, the College will not be \nable to provide supportive measures.  \nBelow is a non -exhaustive list of protections and campus accommodations that may be \navailable,  if appropriate.  To request  any of the below  supportive  measures,  please contact \nyour campus Title IX Coordinator.  Your Title IX Coordinator will then make the \nnecessary arrangements,  including  coordinating  with other  campus  offices  as needed,  in \norder to maintain your privacy.  \ni. No-Contact  Order  \nHaving the College issue a one -way ‘no contact’ order against the accused or a \nmutual  no-contact  order  against  both the accused  and the victim.  A no-contact  order \ncan be formulated appropriately as the circumstances warrant.  The no -contact can \nrange from prohibited communication to prohibiting physical contact.  \nA one -way ‘no contact’ order requires a fact -specific inquiry to determine whether \nimposition of such an order would be punitive, disciplinary, or unreasonably \nburdensome to the other party.  In cases where a one -way no -contact  order would \nhelp enforce  a restraining  order,  preliminary  injunction,  or other  court -mandated  22  protective  order  or if such an order  would  not unreasonably burden the  other  party, \na one -way no -contact order may be appropriate.  \nWhen a one -way n o-contact order is issued, if the accused, victim, or reporting \nindividual observes each other in a public place, it will be the responsibility of the \naccused to avoid contact on the accused, leave the area immediately and without \ndirectly  contacting the reporting  individual  and/or  victim.  If necessary,  the College \nmay establish  a schedule  for the accused  and the victim  to access  College  buildings \nand property at separate times.  Violating the ‘no contact’ order could subject the \naccused to additional conse quences and/or the involvement of law enforcement.  \nBoth the accused and the victim will, upon request and consistent with these policies, \nbe afforded a prompt review, reasonable under the circumstances of the need for and \nterms of the ‘no contact’ order, i ncluding potential modification and will be allowed \nto submit evidence in support of their his or her request.  \nii. Assistance  from  College  associates  in obtaining  an order  of protection  or restraining \norder from law enforcement against the accused individual.  \nOrders  of protection  and restraining  orders  are similar  to ‘no contact’  orders,  except \nthat they are imposed by a court, not by the College.  If an accused individual \nviolates an order or protection or restraining order, they could be arrested.  The \nCollege reserves the right to impose consequences on accused individuals who \nviolate orders of protection and restraining orders, such as imposing additional \nconduct charges and/or subjecting the accused to interim suspension.  \niii. Assistance  from  College  campus  securi ty in calling  on & assisting  law enforcement \nin effecting an arrest when the accused individual violates an order of protection.  \niv. Emergency  Removal,  Interim  Suspension  or Administrative  Leave  \nWhen the accused is determined to present a continuing threat to the health and \nsafety of the community, to subject the accused or victim to emergency removal, \ninterim  suspension  or administrative leave pending the outcome of the disciplinary \nprocess  consistent  with the law and the College’s  policies  and procedures.  Both  the \naccused or victim and the reporting individual shall, upon request and consistent \nwith the College’s  policies  and procedures,  be afforded  a prompt  review,  reasonable \nunder  the circumstances,  of the need  for and terms  of emergency  removal,  an interim \nsuspension, or administrative leave and shall be allowed to submit evidence in \nsupport of his or her request.  \nDeterminations of whether an accused poses a continuing threat to the health and \nsafety  of the College  community  are made  by individuals  at each campus.  In making \nsuch determinations,  these  individuals  act in good  faith and takes  into consideration:  \n• Whether  the accused  has a history  of violent  behavior  or is a repeat  offender  \n• Whether  the reporting  individual  is a minor  \n• The nature  of the allegation  in question  \n• Subsequent  behavior  occurring  after the allegation  \n• The potential  risk of harm  or disruption  to the campus  community  and the \nreporting individual  \n• Other  relevant  factors,  such as whether  the alleged  behavior  represents  an \nescalation  in behavior  from  past incidents,  the possession  and/or  use of a weapon  23  and/or  force,  whether  the College  possesses  other  means  to obtain  evidence  (e.g. \nsecurity  footage),  whether  available  information  reveals  a pattern  of perpetration \nat a given location or by a particular group and whether alternatives to interim \nsuspension or administrative leave are available.  \n• And/or use of a weapon, and whether alternatives to interim suspension are \navailable.  \nWhen  the threat  posed  implicates  mental  health issues,  the victim  will be required  to \nprovide  the College  with documentation  from  an appropriate  healthcare  provider  in \norder to return to campus.  Additional safety precautions may also be taken where \nthe College deems it necessary.  \nWhen certain crimes  occur in certain areas on and/or near campus that represent a \nserious  or continuing  threat  to the campus  community,  the College  is obligated  under \nfederal  law to issue  a timely  warning,  in order  to protect  the safety  of others.  Crimes \ntriggering a timely warning might include, for example, a rapist who is still present \non campus.  When a timely warning is issued, the warning will never identify any \nvictims or reporting individuals.  \nv. Obtaining reasonable and available interim measures and accommodations for \nchanges in the accused’s or victim’s academics, housing, employment, \ntransportation, or other applicable arrangements in order to help ensure safety, \nprevent retaliation, and avoid a hostile environment consistent with the College’s \npolicies and procedures.  \nOther  protections,  services,  and accommodations  that may be appropriate  including, \nfor example, counseling, extensions of deadlines or other course -related \nadjustments, modifications of work or class schedules, campus escort services, \nmutual restrictions on contact between the parties, changes in work or housing \nlocations, leaves of absence, increased security and monitoring of certain areas of \nthe campus.  \n11. Disciplinary  Process  for Allegations  of Sexual  Misconduct  \nIn cases where this Policy is applicable, w hen an accused commits or is believed to have \ncommitted  sexual  misconduct  or other  conduct  prohibited  by this Policy  – whether  committed \nagainst another student, other member of the campus community, or non -member of the \ncampus  community  – the accused  may face conduct  charges  and be subjected  to the College’s \ndisciplinary process.  All accused who are subjected to the disciplinary process are entitled to \na presumption of ‘not responsible’ (not guilty), and all processes will be conducted in a fair,  \nimpartial , thorough,  and timely  manner.  However,  there  may circumstances  where  prior to  the \nconclusion  of the disciplinary  proceedings,  the College  deems  it necessary  to carry  out the \nemergency removal or interim suspension of a student or placing an employee on \nadministrative leave.  \nAt all times, the burden of proof and the burden of gathering evidence is on the College to \nestablish that the alleged violation of this policy was committed by the Respondent. The \nstandard of evidence required in both the Sexual Misc onduct Hearing and in the Appeal \nHearing, if one is sought, is a preponderance of evidence.  “Preponderance of evidence” \nmeans  that the relevant  Code  of Conduct  committee  must  decide  in favor  of the party  that, as \na whole, has the stronger evidence that the  violation was or was not committed, however \nslight the edge over the other party’s evidence may be. “Preponderance of evidence” is \nsometimes  described  as “more  likely  than not” or “51%  probability.”  The evidence  should  be \nsufficient  to incline  a fair and  impartial  mind  to one side of the issue  over the other,  but it is 24  not necessary  for that mind  to be completely  free from  all reasonable  doubt.  “Preponderance \nof evidence” is a different and lesser standard of evidence than that used in criminal \nproceedings;  rather,  it is the standard  of evidence  often  used in civil court  proceedings.  This \nstandard  will be used for Formal  Complaints  against  both students  and employees,  including \nfaculty.  \nIn all disciplinary  proceedings  brought  against  a Respondent,  there  will be a presumption  that \nthe Respondent is not responsible for the alleged conduct until a determination regarding \nresponsibility is made at the conclusion of the disciplinary process.  \nBefore or after the filing of a Formal Complaint (a nd even where no Formal Complaint has \nbeen filed), the College will offer without fee or charge Supportive Measures to both the \naccused and the victim, as appropriate and as reasonably available.  \n12. Informal  Resolution  Process  \nAt any time prior to a Sexual Misconduct Committee reaching a determination, a \nComplainant may, but is not required to, seek informal resolution of his or her Formal \nComplaint.  This informal process is not available when the accused is a College employee \nand both parties  must  voluntarily  consent  in writing  to the informal  resolution  process  or such \na process will not be permitted.  An informal resolution avoids a full investigation and \nCommittee hearing and allows the parties to mediate a resolution.  The informal resolution \nprocess is not available unless a Formal Complaint has been submitted. If a Complainant \nseeks  an informal  resolution,  both the Respondent  and the Complainant  will be sent a written \nnotice disclosing:  \nA. That if the parties  reach  a mutually  acceptable  resolution  to which  they agree  in writing, \nthe Complainant will be prevented from resuming a Formal Complaint arising from the \nsame allegations;  \nB. Any party has a right to withdraw from the informal resolution process and resume the \nFormal Complaint process. \\ \nC. Should  a party  withdraw  from  the informal  resolution  process,  all records  resulting  from \nthe informal  resolution  process  that could  have  been  maintained  by the College  or shared \nwith the College  or the other  party  will be shared  or maintained  in the Formal  Complaint \nprocess.  \n13. Sexual  Misconduct  Review/Investigation  Process  \nReports of potential and actual violations of this policy, will be processed as follows. All \nwritten notifications referenced below will be provided to both parties in a manner that \nrequires  the parties to acknowledge receipt, such as certified mail or email, return receipt \nrequested or hand delivery with a signed receipt.  \nAll submitted reports and  Formal Complaints regarding incidents of sexual misconduct will \nbe reviewed by the Title IX Coo rdinator.  \nThe Title IX Coordinator may not have a conflict of interest or bias for or against the \nComplainant or the Respondent specifically or for or against Complainants or Respondents \ngenerally.  A designee for the Title IX Coordinator will be appointed if a conflict exists.  \nIn all cases  where  a Formal  Complaint  is submitted  by a Complainant  or signed  by a Title  IX \nCoordinator,  the Title  IX Coordinator  (or his/her  designee)  will conduct  an investigation  into \nthe incident  reported.  Upon  the submission  of a Formal  Complaint,  the victim  will be referred \nto as the “Complainant” and the accused will be referred to as the “Respondent.”  \nWhen  a Formal  Complaint  is submitted,  the College  will provide  a written  notice  to both the 25  Complainant  (if known)  and the Respondent  containing:  \nA. A description  of the Code  of Conduct  process,  including  the informal  resolution  process;  \nB. The allegations of violation of behavior prohibited in this policy with sufficient details \nknown at the time the notice is drafted.  The description of the allegations include the \nidentities of the parties involved in the incident, if known, the conduct allegedly \nconstituting sexual harassment as defined in this  policy, and the  date and location of  the \nalleged incident, if known.  \nC. A stateme nt that the Respondent  is presumed  not responsible  for the alleged  conduct  and \nthat a determination regarding responsibility is made at the conclusion of the Sexual \nMisconduct Hearing.  \nD. A statement that the parties may have an advisor of their choice, who m ay be,  but is not \nrequired to be an attorney.  \nE. Notice  that the parties  may inspect  and review  evidence.  \nF. The College’s prohibition of knowingly making false statements or knowingly \nsubmitting false information during the Code of Conduct process.  \nDuring  the course  of any investigation,  if investigation  is pursued  about  allegations  of either \na Complainant  or a Respondent  that were  not included  in this notice,  the College  will provide \nnotice of those allegations to the parties whose identities are known.  \nIn cas es where a Formal Complaint has not been submitted by a Complainant, victims who \nhave reported an incident of sexual misconduct – whether done so privately, confidentially, \nor anonymously  – have  the option  of requesting  that the College  not conduct  an investigation; \nhowever, under certain circumstances, the College may determine that an investigation is \nnecessary to protect the health and safety of other students and/or the College community. \nWhen  the College  determines  that an investigation  is necessar y, the victim  will be treated  as \na party in any disciplinary proceeding. Victims who have anonymously submitted a report \nregarding  an incident  of sexual  misconduct  should  be aware  that their anonymity  may inhibit \nthe College’s  ability to conduct  a full investigation  of the incident  and/or  communicate  with \nthe victim  regarding  actions  taken.  In addition,  such anonymity  will inhibit  the ability  of the \nCollege to provide the victim supportive measures.  \nAny investigation  conducted  will be done  so in a fair, impartial,  thorough,  and timely  manner. \nThe burden  of gathering  the evidence  will be on the College  and not on the parties.  However, \nthe College  may not  access,  consider,  or otherwise  use a party’s  records  that are: 1) made  or \nmaintained  by a physician,  psychiatrist,  or other  recognized  professional  or paraprofessional \nacting  in their professional’s  or paraprofessional’s  capacity,  or assisting  in that capacity,  and \n2) which  are made  and maintained  in connection  with the provision  of treatment  to the party. \nHowever,  the College  may access,  consider,  and use these  records  if the College  that party’s \n(or the party’s parent’s, if necessary) voluntary, written consent to do so for a disciplinary \nproceeding.  \nThe parties will be provided equal opportunity to  inspect and review any evidence obtained \nas part of the investigation  that is directly  related  to the allegations  in the Formal  Complaint, \nincluding  evidence  that the College  does not intend  to rely upon  in reaching  a determination \nregarding responsibilit y. This includes such evidence that is inculpatory or exculpatory \nwhether it was obtained from a party or another source.  Such access will be provided to \nensure that the parties are able to meaningfully respond to the evidence at the conclusion of \nthe inve stigation.  \nTo this end, before  the Investigator  completes  his or her investigative  report,  the College  will 26  send to each party and the party’s advisor, if any, the evidence subject to inspection and \nreview in an electronic format or a hard copy, and the parties will be provided ten (10) \nbusiness days to submit a written response.  Any such responses will be considered prior to \ncompletion  of the investigative  report.  At any hearing  that follows,  this evidence  will be made \navailable  to the parties and both parties  will have  equal  opportunity  to refer  to such evidence \nduring the hearing, including for purposes of cross -examination.  \nShould investigative interviews or meetings be necessary or should an individual’s \nparticipation at the hearing be requested, the Investigator will provide written notice to the \nindividual  whose  interview,  meeting,  or hearing  participation  is requested  with the date,  time, \nlocation, participants, and the purpose of the interview, meeting, or hearing  15 days before \nthe date of the hearing or as soon as possible but with sufficient time for the participant to \nprepare for the meeting or interview.  \nUpon completion of the investigation, the Investigator will prepare an investigative report \nwhich fairly summarizes the relevan t evidence.  If it is decided that the Respondent should \nbe subject to proceedings under the Sexual Misconduct hearing process, each party and any \nadvisor will be provided a copy of the report in an electronic format or a hard copy at least \n10 days before t he hearing.  Both parties will be given an opportunity to submit a written \nresponse to the report which will be due no later than 3 business days before the hearing.  \nIf upon the completion of the investigation, it is determined that there is sufficient evid ence \nto proceed  to a hearing,  written  notice  will be provided  to the Respondent,  Complainant,  and \nany other party whose participation is invited or expected.  The notice will contain the date, \ntime,  location,  participants,  and the purpose  of the hearing  at least 15 days before  the date of \nthe hearing.  The date selected by the Title IX Coordinator will provide the Respondent a \nreasonable amount of time to prepare for the Sexual Misconduct Hearing while also not \nconstituting an unreasonable delay in resolving the charges. When an alleged violation \ninvolves more than one victim or more than one Complainant, or when more than one \nviolation  is alleged  to have been  committed  by the Respondent,  the Title  IX Coordinator  may \ndetermine, in his/her discretion, to schedu le separate Sexual Misconduct Hearings.  \nUpon completion of the investigation, if the Investigator determines: 1) that the conduct \nalleged  in the Formal  Complaint  would  not constitute  “sexual  harassment”  or “retaliation”  as \ndefined in this Policy even if proved; 2)  that the alleged conduct did not occur with respect \nto locations, events, or circumstances over which the College exercises substantial control \nover the Respondent  and the context  in which  the alleged  sexual  harassment  occurs;  or 3) that \nthe alleged  conduct  did not occur  against  a person  physically  located  in the United  States,  the \nCoordinator will dismiss the Formal Complaint with respect to a claim of violation of Title \nIX, but may continue  the proceeding  if the Coordinator  believes  there  is other  conduct  that \n, if proven,  would  violate  another  provision  of this Policy.  \nThe Investigator may also dismiss the Formal Complaint if at any time during the \ninvestigation  or the hearing,  if: 1) the Complainant  notifies  the Title  IX Coordinator  in writi ng \nthat he or she would like to withdraw the Formal Complaint or any allegations in it; 2) \nRespondent is no longer enrolled or employed by the College; or 3) specific circumstances \nprevent the College from gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determina tion as to the \nFormal  Complaint  or allegations  in it. If the Formal  Complaint  is dismissed,  the College  will \npromptly  send written  notice  of the dismissal  and the reasons  for the dismissal  simultaneously \nto all of the parties.  \n14. Sexual  Misconduct  Hearing  Process  27  When the Investigator files Sexual Misconduct charges against the Respondent, the \nInvestigator will promptly notify the Respondent in writing of the facts of the allegations \nmade against him/her, the specific College policy violation committed by the Respondent if \nthe alleged facts are determined to have occurred, the time and date on which the violation \nallegedly occurred, possible consequences and/or sanctions against the student for such \nviolation,  information  regarding  how the student can dispute  the violation  alleged  (including \nthe date,  time,  and location  of a Sexual  Misconduct  Hearing  at which  the Respondent  will be \nentitled to present evidence), and what (if any) supportive measures will be imposed upon \nthe student while the Student Conduct Hearing is in progress (e.g., temporary suspension). \nWhere  the alleged  violation  involves  sexual  harassment  or sexual  harassment  retaliation,  the \nwritten notice will also notify the parties of their right to be accompanied at the Sexual \nMisconduct Hearing by an advisor of his/her choice.  \nThe Sexual  Misconduct  Hearing  will be conducted  in a fair, impartial,  and thorough  manner. \nThe Sexual  Misconduct  will be presided  over by a Sexual  Misconduct  Committee,  which  will \nbe composed of impartial individuals selected by the Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX \nCoordinator may not serve on the Committee. Committee members may not have a conflict \nof interest or bias for or against Complainants or Respondents generally or an individual \nComplainant or Re spondent specifically.  \nThe Committee will hear all evidence presented on the alleged violation. During the Sexual \nMisconduct  Hearing,  the Respondent  will have the opportunity  to present  evidence  in his/her \ndefense  and to inspect  and review  evidence  be accompanied  by an advisor  of his/her  choice. \nLikewise, the Complainant may, if he/she desires, also have the opportunity to present \nevidence  of the incident  and to be accompanied  by an advisor  of his/her  choice.  Such  advisor \nfor both parties may be,  but is not required  to be, an attorney.  Such  advisor  may accompany \nthe party not only at the hearing but also at any interview or meeting.  However, the \ninvestigator  and the Committee  may establish  restrictions  on the extent  to which  the advisor \nmay participate  in the hearing,  interview,  or meeting.  Such  restrictions  will apply  equally  to \nboth parties.  \nDuring the hearing, the Committee will objectively evaluate all of the relevant evidence — \nincluding both inculpatory (evidence indicating culpability) and exculpatory  evidence \n(evidence indicating lack of culpability).  The Committee will not make credibility \ndeterminations based on a person’s status as a Complainant, Respondent, or witness.  \nThe Sexual Misconduct Committee will not require, allow, rely upon, or otherwis e use \nquestions or evidence that constitute, or seek disclosure of, information protected under a \nlegally recognized privilege, unless the person holding such privilege has waived the \nprivilege.  \nDuring  the course  of the Sexual  Misconduct  Hearing,  the Colle ge will not restrict  the ability \nof either party to discuss the allegations under investigation or to gather and then present \nrelevant evidence.  The parties will be given an equal opportunity to present witnesses, \nincluding fact and expert witnesses, and o ther inculpatory and exculpatory evidence.  \nThe Sexual  Misconduct  Hearing  will be live (in person)  with the following  procedural  rights \nand restrictions:  \nA. The Sexual  Misconduct  Committee  will decide  on the location  of the hearing.  Depending \non the circumstances, the Committee may hold the hearing with all parties physically \npresent in the same geographic location or it may decide to have any or all parties, \nwitnesses, and other participants to appear at the live hearing virtually, with technology \nenabling  participants  simultaneously  to see and hear each other.  An audio  or audiovisual  28  recording, or transcript, of any live hearing will be made available to the parties for \ninspection and review.  This record will be maintained for seven years.  \nB. The Committee  will permit  each party’s  advisor  to cross -examine  the other  party  and any \nwitnesses’ relevant questions and follow -up questions, including those that challenge \ncredibility.  \nC. If a party does not have an advisor present at the live hearin g, the College will provide \nwithout fee or charge to that party, an advisor of the College’s choice, who may be, but \nis not required to be, an attorney, to conduct cross -examination on behalf of that party.  \nD. All cross -examination will be conducted directly,  orally, and in real time by the party’s \nadvisor and never by the party personally.  Only relevant cross -examination and other \nquestions may be asked of a party or witness.  The party or individual being examined by \nthe other party’s advisor will await a rel evancy determination from the Committee Chair \nbefore answering each question.  Should the Committee Chair exclude the question, the \nChair will explain the reason for the exclusion.  \nE. If a party or witness does not submit to cross -examination at the live heari ng, the \nCommittee will not rely on any statement of that party or witness in reaching a \ndetermination regarding responsibility.  However, the Committee will not draw an \ninference  about  the determination  regarding  Respondent’s  responsibility  based  solely  on \na party’s or witness’s absence from the live hearing or refusal to answer cross - \nexamination or other questions.  \nF. If either party so requests, the hearing will be carried out with the parties located in \nseparate  rooms  with technology,  such as video  conferencing,  which  enables  the Code  of \nConduct Committee and the parties to simultaneously see and hear the party or witness \nanswering questions.  \nG. Questions and evidence about the Complainant’s sexual predisposition or prior sexual \nbehavior are not relevan t, unless such questions and evidence about the Complainant’s \nprior sexual behavior are offered to prove that someone other than the Respondent \ncommitted the conduct alleged by the Complainant, or if the questions and evidence \nconcern  specific  incidents  of the Complainant’s  prior  sexual  behavior  with respect  to the \nRespondent and are offered to prove consent;  \nH. After  all evidence  has been  presented  in the hearing,  the Committee  will render  a decision \nas to whether the Respondent is “responsible” (guilty) or “ not responsible” (not guilty) \nfor the violation and will impose consequences and/or sanctions on the Respondent if \nfound “responsible”, if appropriate. If the Respondent fails to or declines to attend the \nhearing,  the hearing  will be held without  the Respondent  present  and the Committee  may \nreach  a decision  of “responsible”  and impose  consequences  and/or  sanctions  even  in the \nRespondent’s absence. However, the Committee will not make a determination based \nsolely on the absence of the Respondent.  \nI. Upon  conclusion  of the hearing,  the Committee  will privately  deliberate  and will issue  a \nwritten  determination  applying  the preponderance  of the evidence  standards.  The written \ndetermination  will be simultaneously  sent to both parties  within  5 days of the conclusion \nof the hearing and will include:  \ni. A summary  of the allegations  including  which  provisions  of this policy  were  alleged \nto be violated;  \nii. A summary of the procedural steps the College carried out from receipt of the \nFormal  Complaint  through  the deter mination,  including  notifications  to the parties,  29  any interviews with parties and/or witnesses, any site visits, other methods used to \ngather evidence, and hearings held.  \niii. Findings  of fact supporting  the determination;  \niv. Conclusions  regarding  the application  of this policy  to the facts;  \nv. With respect to each allegation, a statement of the determination of responsibility, \nany disciplinary sanctions imposed, and whether any restorative remedies will be \nprovided to the Complainant;  \nvi. A description  of the process  and permissible  bases  for either  the Complainant  or the \nRespondent to appeal. The Committee will not make a determination based solely \non the absence of the Respondent.  \nEither  the Respondent  “responsible”  or the Complainant  may commence  his/her  appeal \nby following the procedures described in the paragraphs titled “Appeals Process” \nbelow. In the  event an appeal is requested, the Committee’s decision will  be protected \nfrom public release by the College until the Appeals Process is complete and final, \nunless  the law requires  otherwise.  However,  the parties  involved  may choose  whether \nor not to discuss or disclose the outcome of the hearing.  \nIf a party does not commence an appeal within ten days from receiving written \nnotification of the Commi ttee’s decision, then the Committee’s decision will be final.  \n15. Appeals  Process  \nAny Respondent found “responsible” by a Sexual Misconduct Committee and any \nComplainant following a dismissal or finding of “not responsible” may appeal the \nCommittee’s decisions , including its determination of responsibility and/or the \nconsequences/sanctions imposed.  \nAny party seeking an appeal of the Committee’s decision(s) (“Appellant”) must submit a \nwritten  request  for an appeal  to the Title  IX Coordinator  within  ten days of receiving  written \nnotification  of the Committee’s  decision.  The written  request  for appeal  must  include  a brief \nstatement of the basis of the appeal.  Permissible bases for appeal are:  \nA. A procedural  irregularity  that affected  the outcome  of the matter;  \nB. New evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the Committee made the \ndetermination regarding responsibility or dismissal, which could affect the outcome of \nthe matter;  \nC. The Title IX Coordinator, Investigator, or a member of the Sexual Misconduct \nCommittee had a conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents, \nin general, or the individual Complainant or Respondent specifically that affected the \noutcome of the matter;  \nD. The burden  of proof  was met or was not met but the Committe e concluded  otherwise;  \nE. The appealing party objects to the Committee’s determination of responsibility, the \nimposed consequences/sanctions, or both.  \nUpon receiving the Appellant’s written request for appeal, the Title IX Coordinator will \nschedule  the date for an Appeal  Hearing,  to be  held in a timely manner  at a campus  location \nor virtually.  Upon scheduling the Appeal Hearing, the Title IX Coordinator will provide \nwritten notification of the location, date, and time to both the Respondent and the \nComplainan t. 30  The Appeal  Hearing  will be conducted  in a fair, impartial,  and thorough  manner.  The Appeal \nHearing will be presided over by a panel of impartial individuals selected by the Title IX \nCoordinator.  The Title  IX Coordinator,  any individual  who served  on the Sexual  Misconduct \nCommittee, or the Investigator may not serve on the Appeal Hearing panel. In addition, no \nmember of the Appeal Hearing panel may have a conflict of interest or bias for or against \ncomplainants or respondents, in general, or  the Complainant or Respondent specifically. \nWhen such an appeal is submitted, the non -appealing  party will be notified in writing of the \nappeal and these procedures will be applied equally to both parties.  Both parties will be \ngiven  the opportunity  to submit a written  statement  in support  of or challenging  the outcome \nof the Committee’s determination before the Appeal Hearing.  \nThe Appeal Hearing panel will hear all arguments presented in regard to whether the \nCommittee’s decisions were appropriate. After a ll arguments have been presented, the \nAppeal  Hearing  panel  will render  a written  decision  on the appealed  issues  and, if appropriate, \nimpose revised consequences/sanctions on a party. Within five days of the Appeal Hearing, \nthe parties will simultaneously be sent written notification of the Appeal Hearing panel’s \ndecision and the rationale for such decision. The Appeal Hearing panel’s decisions are final \nand are not subject to further appeal.  \n16. Timeframes  \nAny of the deadlines  in this Policy  may be extended  upon  the showing  of good  cause.  When \nconsidering whether to grant an extension, the absence of a party, a party’s advisor, or a \nwitness, concurrent law enforcement activity, or the need for language assistance, or \naccommodation of disabilities will be cons idered.  Where extensions are granted, the \nComplainant and Respondent will be provided written notice of the extension or delay and \nthe reasons for the action.  \n17. Possible  Sanctions  \nThe following  possible  sanctions  may be imposed  as a result  of a Sexual  Miscon duct Hearing \nand/or an Appeal Hearing.  In addition, if at any point (whether during or prior to any such \nhearing) the presence of a student or College associate on campus creates a threat to the \nhealth, safety, and/or well -being of other students or other members of the College \ncommunity, the College reserves the right to immediately remove that individual from \ncampus until the time of the Sexual Misconduct Hearing and/or Appeal Hearing.  \nThe following list of the range of possible consequences/sanctions is not exhaustive, and \nthese consequences/sanctions may be imposed singularly or in any combination.  Different \nand/or additional consequences or sanctions may be imposed by a Sexual Misconduct \nCommittee and/or Appeal Hearing panel as they may deem appropriate.

Written Warning:  A notice in writing that the Respondent is violating or has violated \ninstitutional regulations.  \nC. Probation:  A written reprimand for violation of specified regulations which places the \nRespondent  in a probationary  status  for a designated  period  of time.

This may be imposed in addition to any interim “no \ncontact” order already issued.  \nI.

For a Respondent  who withdraws  from  the College \nwhile such charges are pending, and declines to complete the disciplinary process, the \nCollege will make a notation stating, “Withdrew with conduct charges pending.” \nTranscript  notations  regarding  expulsion,  suspension  and withdrawal  shall  be permanent. \nSuspended  Respondent  students  may appeal  such notation  and seek its removal  after one \nyear after conclusion of the suspension.  A Respondent student subjected to suspens ion \nor expulsion,  and by extension  subjected  to an automatic  transcript  notation,  may appeal \nthis sanction by commencing the appeals process within the required timeframe. If a \nfinding of responsibility is vacated for any reason, any such transcript notati on shall be \nremoved.  \nN. Other consequences and/or sanctions as deemed appropriate by the Sexual Misconduct \nCommittee and/or Appeal Hearing panel.  \nVI.

Policy  \nThe College’s policy prohibits discrimination in employment against disabled individuals and is \ncommitted to ensuring equal employment opportunities for disabled individuals. The College  will \nprovide reasonable accommodations to employees and applicants for College positions protected \nby this policy by making changes in the work environment or by changing certain practices and \nprocedures —as long as these changes do not pose an undue hardship on the operation of the \nCollege’s  programs  or activit ies. Employees  must  maintain  institutional  standards  of performance, \nattendance, and conduct as specified by the Department, School, or Division.  \nAll medical information related to an individual's request for accommodation is confidential and \nwill be maint ained by the Department of Human Resources in a confidential file separate from an \nemployee’s  personnel  file. Funding  for accommodations  will be handled  in the same  fashion  as any \nother departmental expenditure. If the unit has insufficient funds, it must seek additional funding \nthrough its regular administrative resources.  \nII. Procedures  \nProcedure  for requesting  an accommodation  to perform  the essential  functions  of a position,  for all \ncampuses (for the person's current position or a position for which the per son is applying):  \n1. To receive an accommodation, employees and applicants must submit the Request for \nReasonable Accommodation Form  with the Department of Human Resources. Employees are \npermitted to  make the request on College time, but  they must  first reque st approval from  their \nappropriate Administrator.  \n2. During the initial meeting with the Department of Human Resources, two things will be \naccomplished:  \nA. The Department  of Human  Resources  will determine  what  documentation  from  a licensed \nprofessional is needed  to support the employee's request for accommodation.  \nB. The responsibilities  of the College  and the employee  will be clarified.  \n3. After reviewing the documentation and the facts of each request, the Department of Human \nResources will determine if the employee is eligible for accommodations.  \n4. The Department of Human Resources will review the marginal and essential functions of the \njob, the functional limitations of the disability, and the reasonableness of an accommodation. \nIt will then facilitate a discussion wi th the appropriate Administrator and the employee to \ndetermine what accommodations may be reasonable.  \n5. The Department of Human Resources may seek advice from third -party experts when \nnecessary.  Only  the Department  of Human  Resources  will retain  medical  documentation  which \nwill be kept in a separate  confidential  file and it will only share  medical  information  on a need - \nto-know basis. Supervisors will be informed of the functional limitations and the \naccommodation.  63  6. It is the responsibility of the Department of Human Resources office to determine the \nreasonable accommodation in a particular case after reviewing all the facts.  The Department \nof Human  Resources  will outline  the process  for providing  the accommodation  verbally  and in \nwriting to the employee and his/her department.  \n7. The employee  is responsible  for contacting  the Department  of Human  Resources  if reasonable \naccommodations are not implemented in an effective and timely manner or if the \naccommodations are not working. The Department of  Human Resources will work with the \nemployee and his/her department to resolve disagreements regarding recommended \naccommodations.  \n8. Should the Department of Human Resources determine the person with the disability cannot \nbe reasonably accommodated, then:  \nA. An employee  seeking  an accommodation  in a current  position  will be placed  on the layoff \nlist and be considered  for placement  into vacant  positions  in accordance  with the Reduction \nin Force policy and procedures for filling vacancies.  \nB. Any applicant  seeking  an accommodation  for a position —including  an employee  applying \nfor a position —will be encouraged to continue to seek other employment opportunities \nwith the College.  \nRequesting an accommodation to participate in the selection process or to participate in \nemployment -related College programs.  \n1. A disabled person, whether an employee or applicant, who needs an accommodation to \nparticipate in a selection process (such as a test or an interview) for a College position, must \ncontact the Department of Human Resourc es to request an accommodation.  \n2. An employee who meets the definition of a disabled person who needs an accommodation to \nparticipate in an employment -related College program, event, or benefit, must contact the \nDepartment of Human Resources to request an ac commodation.  \n3. The request  for accommodation  must  come  in a timely  manner  to allow  the Human  Resources \nto respond to the request.  \n4. The department or unit that receives a request for an accommodation may contact the \nDepartment  of Human  Resources  for assistance  in determining  if the individual  is disabled  and, \nif so, for assistance in making a reasonable accommodation.  \n5. The department or unit will document all requests for accommodations, responses to the \nrequests, and forward any medical records to the Departmen t of Human Resources.  \n6. Employees who violate this policy are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including \ntermination.  \n7.

Facilitation of original student research, and \nthe development  of textbooks,  workbooks,  computer  software,  and other  teaching  resources  are \nother  kinds  of scholarship.  Evidence  of such scholarl y contributions  is favorably  considered  in \nfaculty members’ annual performance evaluation and ranking.  \nNOTE: Although the College may be able to support some such scholarship there is no \nobligation  by the College  to do so and, therefore,  faculty  may have  to carry  out such scholarly \nendeavors on their own time and with their own funds.  \n11. Class  Cancellation  \nThe decision  to cancel  classes  is taken  seriously.  The reputation  of the College  and the integrity \nof our academic  programs  rely on every  class  being  conducted  according  to the schedule.  There \nare future  financial  ramifications  for students  and their employers  whenever  a class  is not held. \nFor every class cancellation, faculty should consider the following expectations.  \nC. Inclement  Weather  Cancellations  \nFaculty is responsible for notifying students and their Dean directly of the decision to \ncancel a class. Administrative assistants or other support staff should not be expected to \nassume this responsibility for any faculty member.  \nIf an institutional decision is made to close the College for inclement weather conditions, \nfaculty  members  do not need  to contact  students.  Faculty  will reschedule  a cancelled  class.  \nD. Anticipated  absence  \nFaculty  shall  announce  cancellation  to students  well in advance  – in the syllabus  if possible. \nAlternative activities or assignments will be shared with students to make up the time.  \nE. Emergency  Absence  \nOccasionally  a medical  or personal  emergency  arises  which  necessitates  canceling  a class \nat the last minute.  If possible,  Faculty  will notify  students.  Any emergency  absence  should \nbe reported to the Dean as soon as possible, either by the faculty member or the \nadministrative assistant.  \n12. Course  Cancellation  \nWhen there is insufficient enrollment, unavailability of an instructor , or budgetary constraint, \nthe School Deans in consultation with the impacted faculty has the right to cancel the course \nby the end of the first week of classes. Students enrolled in a course that is cancelled will be \ndropped automatically and notified to see their advisor.  \nF. Priority  of keeping  classes  open:  \ni. Course  needed  for graduation  for current  or the next semester  \nii. Course  needed  to follow  the two-year AA or four-year BA graduation  plan.  73  iii. Course  needed  has not been offered  within  the last year.  \niv. Course  is highly  technical  or a highly  specialized  for a limited  number  of students  and \nwill not likely meet the five minimum practice requirement and has not been offered \nduring the same academic year  \n13. Capping  Class  Enrollment  \nOptimal class size is between 20 and 30. Capping class size is based on classroom capacity, \ncourse  content,  and safety.  The School  Dean  sets the cap and must  give approval  for raising  it. \nDecisions about optimal class size must be made in consultation with impacted faculty of t he \naffected class, but are ultimately up to the discretion of the School Dean.  \n14. Class  Scheduling  \nIn creating course schedules, faculty members will work with their School Dean and consider \nthe following:  \nG. Established  course  sequences.  \nH. The requirement that Schools offer courses at different times (mornings, afternoons, and \nevenings), including weekends, and via different modes (e.g., ITV and online) based on \nstudent needs, and classroom availability.  \nI. This schedule  may be submitted  to the School  Dean  in any format  acceptable  under  School \nguidelines.  Use of digital  (i.e., computerized)  Course  Scheduling  Request  forms  (“CSRs”) \nby faculty members is required.  \nJ. Requests for teaching any course that is less than 16 weeks during the Fall or Spring \nsemesters must be a ccompanied by a justification.  The School Dean will make the final \ndetermination.  \nK. School Deans with Administrative Assistants are responsible for submitting all CSRs by \nthe established deadline.  \nL. School Deans consult with Center Directors/Managers about course offerings and \nschedules. School Deans make final decisions about course offerings, schedules, and \nstaffing.  \n2. Student  Counseling  Service  Referrals  \nStudent  Success  Center  provides  an array  of services  for students.  Services  include  reasonable \ndisability accommodations and counseling services. For a student who is in need of these \nservices, faculty should notify a designated individual from Student Success Center e.g. \nDisability  Coordinator  and/or Counselor.  It is important  to refer  students  in a timely  fashion  to \nimpact their performance and well -being.  \n3. Addressing  Disruptive  Behaviors  \nDisruptive  behavior  in the classroom  is left to the discretion  of the individual  faculty  member. \nIf a student displays such behavior, the faculty member should deal with it early and directly \nby speaking to the student. If it continues to be a problem, the faculty member may ask the \nstudent to leave the classroom and should report the student to the appropriate Sc hool Dean \nwho in turn will make a report to the student counselors. An Incident Report Form should be \nkept for each instance of disruptive behavior, including how it was addressed. At the faculty \nmember's request and with appropriate documentation, the Sch ool Dean will administratively \nwithdraw the student from class or classes in accordance with faculty course syllabus and the \nStudent Conduct. Faculty can call the Campus Security at any time the situation warrants.  74  15. Equipment  and Supplies  \nThe use of all audio -visual equipment for instructional purposes is coordinated by the School \nDean  and faculty member. Instructional  supplies may be  ordered  by faculty members through \npurchase requisitions approved by the School Dean. Reimbursements are not gu aranteed \nwithout the School Dean’s prior approval. Faculty members are not responsible for providing \nsupplies to students.  \n16. Field  Trips  \nFaculty  members  may schedule  learning  experiences  away  from  the College  for which  student \nattendance may be required. Suc h experiences should have the prior approval of the School \nDean,  and students  must  be informed  of the event  in the course  syllabus.  Syllabus  information \nshould  include,  where  possible,  the purpose  of the activity,  travel  logistics  (including  itinerary \nand schedule of events), risks, and any financial responsibilities of the student.  \nThe faculty sponsor must ensure that students complete the Class Release Form at least two \nweeks  prior  to the trip, which  serves  to notify  the students’  other  instructors  about  the field trip \nand gain their approval  for the students  to participate.  The Class  Release  Form  must  be returned \nto the Registrar,  who checks  the academic  standing  of each possible  field trip participant.  Only \nthose students in good academic standing may participate in the trip.  \nEach student who has been approved for the trip must complete a Field Trip Expectation and \nObligations Form. This form spells out trip logistics, expectations and obligations, and \nemergency contacts. It must be compiled by the facu lty sponsor, and turned into the School \nDean, prior to the trip.  \nIf the sponsor(s) intends to  use a school  vehicle for the trip, there are additional  travel request \nforms  to complete.  They  are available  from  the School  Dean  and General  Services.  The School  \nDeans are responsible for ensuring faculty compliance with this policy.  \n17. Grading  \nThe faculty  report  academic  achievement  in letter  grades  and quality  points,  as follows:  \n \nA Superior  4 \nB Above  Average  3 \nC Average  2 \nD Poor 1 \nF Fail 0 \nAU Audit  0 \nW Withdrawn  (Input  by Registrar)  0 \nI Incomplete  (With  appropriate  Incomplete  Form)  0 \nIP In Progress  (Developmental  Course  Only)  0 \nIt is the responsibility of each faculty member to use the above system and to determine the \nrequirements  for each grade  in each of her or his courses.  Faculty  must  enter  final grades  online \nby the deadlines established in the semester calendar and posted by the Registrar’s office.  \nA faculty  member  should  request  a change  of grade  only when  a student  fulfills  and completes \nnecessary  assignments  required  by faculty  member.  If a change  is justified,  it must  be requested \non a Change  of Grade  form  with clear  justification  given;  and it must  be approved  by the School \nDean.  If a student  requests  a change  of grade  which  is denied  by the faculty,  the student  has 75  the right of appeal in accordance with the Provost Appeal process flowchart and student code \nof conduct.  \nAll faculty  members  must  keep  grade  records  for two years  that justify  students'  grades.  \n18. Incompletes  \nA student  that was doing  satisfactory  work  but for reasons  beyond  her or his control,  was unable \nto meet the full requirements of the course during the semester scheduled may request an \n“Incomplete”  (I). The faculty  member  assigning  the “I” has the responsibility  of submitting  to \nthe registrar’s  office  the proper  forms  describing  the work  to be completed.  This documentation \nis to be filed with the Registrar’s  office  at the time grades  are posted.  A completed  copy  of the \nform  “Incomplete  Grade  Assignment”  must  be submitted  to the Registrar’s  office  at the time a \ngrade  of Incomplete  is assigned,  and the copy  must  be attached  to the “Change  of Grade”  form \nwhen  the “I” is later cleared.  The student  must  complete  and submit  all work  by the end of the \nfollowing semester.  \nStudents who stop attending class prior to midterm will be administratively withdrawn from \nthe course.  A grade  of “I” cannot  be assigned  in this situation.  An incomplete  must  be removed \nbefore the end of the following year whether o r not the student is enrolled; otherwise, the \nincomplete  will be recorded  as an F. A time extension  for completing  an incomplete  requires  a \nwritten request by the faculty to the School Dean explaining the unpreventable delay and \nwritten approval must be given by the School Dean for this extension. The extension must be \nrequested prior to the end of the semester in which the incomplete would be automatically \nchanged.  \n19. In Progress  Grades  \nThis grade indicates that the student has met attendance requirements and has worked \ncontinuously toward meeting the objectives of the course but must re -enroll in the course the \nnext semester that the course is  offered. The IP may be given only once for the same course \nand only in developmental courses in Reading, Writing, and Math.  \n20. Office  Hours  \nFaculty  are required  to schedule  five office  hours  per week  that accommodate  the needs  of the \nstudents.  Faculty  should  also announce  their office  hours  and the location  of their office  at the \nfirst class  meeting.  Office  hour information  must  be posted  outside  the office  as well as stated \nin the course syllabus.  \n21. Course  Syllabi  \nEach faculty member is required to complete a course syllabus for each course taught, a copy \nof which should be kept on file within the Schools. The course syllabus should include:  \n1. Course  number  \n2. Course  title and credits  \n3. Semester  \n4. Class  meeting  time \n5. Class  meeting  location  \n6. Instructor  Name  \n7.

Student  Grievance  Process  \n29. Prepared  by Name  \n30. Reviewed  by (School  Deans)  \n22. Placement  Testing  \nThe College requires all new students to take the reading, writing, math and Navajo language \nplacement tests prior to or during registration to determine class placement. Students are \nexpected to accept the course placement indicated by their tests scores. However, if students \nfeel they should  be placed  into a higher course,  they can challenge  the tests.  If a faculty  member \nin a developmental  class  recommends  (based  on a writing  sample  or other  academic  indicator) \nthat a student be exempted from a course in the developmental sequence, that student may be \nmoved ahea d with concurrence of the School Dean.  \nOnly a School Dean, in consultation with the affected faculty member(s), may override a \nstudent placement.  \nExceptions  may be made  for transfer  students  who have successfully  completed  English,  Math, \nReading or Navajo Language at another institution. For all students, a passing score on the \nreading test or evidence of successful completion of the College's series of reading courses is \nrequired for graduation.  \n23. Textbook  Adoption  77  Faculty is responsible for pl acing orders (if needed) in a timely manner for textbooks when \nCSRs  (Course  Scheduling  Request)  are submitted  to the appropriate  School  Dean  for approval.  \n24.

Adjunct  Faculty  Evaluation  Form  82  \n \nPersonnel  Policies  and \nProcedures Manual   \nEmployment:  Section  3.10 \nAdoption  Date:  07-31-2019  \nEffective  Date : 09-02-2019  \nPolicy:  Staff  and Administrator  Performance  Evaluation  Applicability:  Administrators  and Staff  \nReference(s):  \n \nI. Policy  \nThe College is committed to providing all staff and administrators with meaningful performance \nreviews. Performance reviews are designed to determine how well employees achieve their \nestablished goals and perform job duties. Administrators are responsible for establishing \ndepartmental goals  that contribute to the  College's mission.  They are also responsible for working \nwith each em ployee in the department to establish individual employee goals and duties that \ncontribute to both the department's goals and the College's mission. The College is committed to \nproviding the resources necessary to review and recognize employees based on ac hievement and \nperformance on a regular and ongoing basis.  \nII. Procedures  \nPerformance review and recognition is a clearly defined and ongoing process that contributes to \npositive communication, mutual respect, improved performance, individual growth, and career  \ndevelopment. This ongoing process involves frequent communication between employees and \nsupervisors about goals and duties, performance standards, and expectations. It seeks to provide \ngreater accountability and effectiveness, and to foster a culture of q uality performance and \ncontinuous  improvement  with a focus  on internal  and external  customer  service.  The Performance \nReview program is designed so that employees: (1) are aware of expectations and standards; (2) \nreceive timely feedback about their performance; (3) receive opportunities for improvement, \neducation, training, and career development; and (4) receive recognition in a fair manner.  \nAn employee's performance will be reviewed in a fair and reasonable manner. The performance \nreview may be use d as the basis for personnel decisions, including such things as career \ndevelopment, compensation increases, and disciplinary action, if appropriate.  \n1. Mutual  Responsibility  – Employees  and supervisors  will work  together  to develop  and identify \ngoals, object ives, duties and performance standards that will be the basis of the employee's \nperformance review. They should also agree upon training and development opportunities \nnecessary for high quality performance and excellent service. Supervisors have dual roles  of \nsupervisor and employee.  \n2. Supervisor  Responsibilities  – All employees  who supervise  one or more  staff will be reviewed \non their performance of the supervisory functions listed below and the timeliness and quality \nof the performance  reviews  conducted  for each of their employees.  Supervisors  are responsible \nfor: \nA. completing  training  on performance  review  and recognition;  \nB. establishing  the departmental  goals;  \nC. seeking  input  from employees  and working  with them to  develop  individual  employee \ngoals and duties;  \nD. providing  employees  with clear  expectations,  consistent  measures,  and achievable \nstandards of performance;  \nE. supporting  and providing  resources  for employees  to meet  performance  standards;  83  F. engaging in ongoing performance reviews that include regular feedback on established \ngoals and duties as well as carrying out an annual written performance review for each \ndirect report;  \nG. identifying performance deficiencies, providing assistance and support, and making \ncorrections and improvements;  \nH. assisting  employees in identifying and participating in career development and training \nprograms; and  \nI. recognizing  outstanding  performance  on a regular  and on-going  basis.  \n3. Employee  Responsibilities  - All employees  are responsible  for: \nA. providing input to their supervisor in the development of individual goals that contribute \nto departmental goals and the College's mission;  \nB. meeting  expectations  and achieving  performance  standards;  \nC. providing  their supervisor  with a self-assessment  of accomplishments  with respect  to goals, \nduties, and College values;  \nD. discussing  concerns  and/or  questions  about  any part of their job description  or performance \nreview with their supervisor;  \nE. identifying  and participating  in career  development  and training  opportunities.  \n4. Training  \nTrainin g is critical to a quality performance review and recognition program. Individuals \nresponsible  for reviewing  employee  performance  will complete training  on how  to implement \nthe performance review and recognition program. Additional programs are available t o train, \nsupport, and guide supervisors and employees in performing responsibilities, such as setting \ngoals, giving effective feedback, and writing performance standards.  \n5. Performance  Review  Process  \nThe Performance Review form is both a planning tool and a performance evaluation \ninstrument. At the beginning of the review period the supervisor defines the goals and duties \non which the employee will be reviewed during the upcoming review period and places them \non the Performance Review form. The supervisor mee ts with the employee to discuss the \nexpectations. These expectations are the basis for the employee's performance review. The \nsupervisor will give a copy of the form to the employee to assist the employee in striving for \nexcellence during the review period . \nThe supervisor will provide the employee with regular feedback about his/her performance \nthroughout the year. During the review period, the supervisor should coach and mentor the \nemployee  to assist  the employee  in reaching  his/her  goals  and achieving  optimal  performance. \nThe supervisor is required to complete a written performance review at least annually. The \nsupervisor and employee will meet to discuss the performance review. The employee will be \ngiven  reasonable  advance  notice  of the date of the written performance  review.  The supervisor \nwill ask the employee to complete and submit a self -assessment prior to the performance \nreview.  \n6. Frequency  and Timing  \nSupervisors  will complete  a written  performance  review  for each of his/her  direct  reports  at the \nend of that employee's probation, and thereafter at the end of each review period. The review \nperiod  is January  1 - December  31. The written  performance  review  must  be completed  by 84  March 31 of the following year. The Department of Human Resou rces will verify that all \nperformance reviews are completed by March 31 of each year.  \n7. Ratings  \nThere  are five rating  categories  (from  highest  to lowest):  Exceptional  Performance  (5), Above \nAverage  (4), Meets  Performance  (3), Needs  Improvement  (2), and Poor  Performance  (1). These \nrating categories are used on the Performance Review form to evaluate individual categories \nand overall performance. The overall performance is used to determine merit pay.  \n8. Change  in Supervisor  \nA supervisor  leaving  a position  is required to document  employee  performance  prior  to leaving. \nIf an employee's  supervisor  changes,  the employee  will normally  be reviewed  on the goals  and \nduties,  performance standards,  and expectations stated  in the  last written  performance review. \nThe new supervisor will meet with the employee to discuss and document any changes to the \npreviously stated goals and duties, performance standards, and expectations.  \n9. Finalizing  the Performance  Review  Form  \nAfter  completing  the Performance  Review,  the employee  and supervisor  sign the Performance \nReview form. The supervisor's signature indicates that he/she has followed the process and \ncompleted the form. The employee's signature indicates that he/she has read and understood \nthe Performance Review. The employee's sig nature does not necessarily indicate agreement \nwith the supervisor’s assessment of his/her performance. Supervisors will collect all \ndepartmental  reviews  and submit  them  to the Department  of Human  Resources each  spring  as \npart of the annual merit pay process.  \n10. Employee  Disagreement  with Written  Review  \nIf a post -probationary employee disagrees with his/her written performance review, the \nemployee  may:  (1) attach  a response  to the performance  review  and (2) request  reconsideration \nby the next level superv isor to identify and clarify relevant issues in an attempt to resolve \nconcerns about the performance review. The parties are expected to act in good faith.  \n11. Performance  Improvement  Plan \nWhen the review indicates that performance improvement is needed, a performance \nimprovement  plan will be documented  and discussed  with the employee  by the supervisor.  The \nemployee may be allowed up to 120 calendar days to correct the deficiencies noted in the \nperformance improvement plan. Failure to correct the deficiencies noted in the performance \nimprovement plan may result in disciplinary action.  \n12. Recognition  \nPerformance recognition can take many forms to reward employees who have demonstrated \nexcellence as reflected in their written performance reviews. There are various ways to \nrecognize employees for their achievements. These can include career development \nopportunities, certificates of appreciation, subscriptions to professional journals, and \nmemberships  in professional  organizations.  Supervisors  wishing  to use some  other  methods  of \nrecognition should first consult with the Department of Human Resources to ensure that the \nmethod is in compliance with College policies. In addition to departmental recognition, the \nCollege will also recognize outstanding perform ance.  \n13. Attachments  to the Performance  Review  \nThe College encourages career development for all staff members. Supervisors have the \nresponsibility  to assist  and guide  employees  in their career  development  efforts. The  supervisor  85  and employee  should  discuss  the employee’s  career  development  goals  during  the performance \nreview process, both while planning performance expectations for the year and at the time of \nthe performance  review.  The Career  Plan Form  should  be used to specify  the employee's  career \ndevelopment goals and the actions that will be taken to achieve them.  \n14. Program  Monitoring  \nThe Department  of Human  Resources  will monitor,  track,  and evaluate  the performance  review \nprocess for quality, improvement, and program success.  \n15. Records  Retention  \nCopies of performance reviews will be maintained in the employee's official personnel file at \nthe Department of Human Resources.  \nIII.

If the compensation  is above  minimum,  the compensation \nwill be based on the qualifications in the new position. An average increase ranges from 5 \npercent to 10 percent. Compensation adjustment will be effective until after the initial thirty  \n(30) work  days have  been  exhausted.  \n5. The appropriate Vice President (Provost) should submit a written request/justification to the \nPresident for approval in consultation with the Director of Human Resources.  \n6. Unless impracticable, the supervisor shall notify the employee of the interim assignment or  \nstewardship prior to the effective date of the action.  \n7. A change  in work  schedule  or location  shall  require  a minimum  of two (2) weeks’ notice.  \n8. Upon approval, the appropriate Vice President should provide the employee with a written \nnotice confirming the action.  \n9. A letter  to the employee  outlining  the interim  assignment  or stewardship  should  be attached  to \nthe Request for Personnel Action Form (RPAF).

In the event a furlough is deemed necessary, the effective dates and the terms and \ncondition s of the furlough will be communicated to employees as soon as possible.  \nC. Once a furlough has ended, affected employees will usually be reinstated to the position \nheld at the time of the furlough. However, a furlough does not prevent the College from \nrealig ning or reassigning its resources or from taking additional action to support its \nmission and goals. Furloughed employees in departments which are reorganized or \nrestructured  will be notified.

Policy  \nIt is the College’s  policy  to ensure  that employee  voluntary  and involuntary  separations,  and those \ndue to the death of an employee, are handled in a professional manner with minimal disruption to \nthe workplace.  \nII. Procedures  \nThere  are four (4) types  of separation  of employment:  \n1. Voluntary  \nAn employee informs his/her supervisor of the employee’s resignation in writing. The \nresignation date must not fall on the day after a holiday. If an employee does not provide \nadvance notice or fails to actually work the remaining days before the resignation date, the \nemployee will not be eligible for rehire for at least two (2) years from the date of last \nemployment and will not receive accrued benefits.

Policy  \nDuring  a public  health  emergency involving  a widespread  occurrence  of an infectious  disease  that \neasily  spreads person to person and poses a direct threat of serious illness or death, the College \nmust  require  certain  disclosures  to prevent  the spread  of such disease.  Pursuant  to Section  1.14,  the \nCollege President has authority to declare an emergency under  these conditions.  During such an \nemergency, all employees are required to self -report infection or exposure to others who may be \ninfected with the infectious disease. This self -reporting policy is intended for the safety of the \nemployees and campus community and minimize the spread of the infectious virus.  \nThe College shall seek current guidance from national and local health authorities concerning the \nspecific infectious virus for additional self -disclosure measures to ensure the safety of its \nemplo yees.  \nAll employee  self-disclosure  reports  during  the public  health  emergency  shall  be kept confidential \nto the extent  required  by applicable  law, including  compliance  with the Health  Insurance  Portability \nand Accountability Act (HIPAA), and shall be maint ained as part of the employee’s medical file, \nseparate from the employee’s personnel file.  \nII. Procedures  \nDuring a public emergency for an infectious virus, all employees must notify the College \nDepartment of Human Resources of having been exposed to or tested  positive for an infectious \nvirus before entering the campus or while working from home.  \n1. Employees receiving a positive test or knows he/she was exposed to an infected person shall \nwithin twenty -four (24) hours notify the Department of Human Resources.  \n2. Employees who have tested position for an infectious virus shall provide a list of individuals \nwith whom  the employee  came  in contact  in the last fourteen  (14) days in connection  with their \nemployment.  \n3. The College will disclose to other employees that a co-worker has tested positive for an \ninfectious virus without disclosing any identities.  With consent of the employee, the College \nmay disclose the identity of the employee testing positive.  \n4. Consistent with applicable laws, the College will notify specific  co-workers, students, or \nvendors that a person with whom they were in recent contact with has tested positive and to \ntake appropriate cautionary measures.  \n5. Employees who call in sick may be asked if they are experiencing an infectious virus -related \nsymptom . \n6. Employees testing positive or having been exposed to an infected person will not be allowed \nback to work until medically cleared.  \n7. The College may issue a survey letter to all employees asking if they have tested positive for \nan infectious virus or have b een exposed to an individual infected with the virus.  103  8. After any stay -at-home orders have been lifted, allowing employees to return to work, \nemployees may be required to wear personal protective gear or may be required to take a \ndiagnostic  test before  entering  the workplace.  The College  will seek and consult  guidance  from \nthe national and local levels of government regarding such matters.  \n9. The College may issue a memorandum concerning a specific infectious virus containing the \napplication of eme rgency orders and additional safety or reporting measures, in consultation \nwith appropriate emergency and health authorities.  \n10. In response to the COVID -19 virus pandemic, governmental agencies have made available \nvaccine shots to prevent the spread of the virus and to prevent infection and serious illness. The  \nvirus  pandemic  has created  a significant  risk of exposure  of the virus  and infection  among our \nemployees.  As such, the College has determined the virus to be a significant threat to the health  \nof our employees.  Accordingly,  the College  has determined  that failure  to be vaccinated \nconstitutes a direct threat to other employees and the public.  \nTo address this direct threat, the College has adopted the COVID -19 virus vaccination as a \ncondition of employme nt to conduct work activities on College premises. An objection to the \nvirus  vaccination  based  on medical  reasons  or religious  belief  will be considered  on a case-by- \ncase basis, and reasonable accommodation may be provided.  The College will issue a health  \nmemorandum by which the College employees will be notified of the time period by which \nthey must be vaccinated and will be provided information as to how to obtain the vaccine \ninoculation.  An employee’s failure to obtain such vaccination will also be cons idered on a \ncase-by-case basis.  \nIII. Definitions  \n1.

Policy  \nThe College considers it very important that employees are well groomed, neat, and dressed \nappropriately for job function and responsibility. The College trusts each employee’s common \nsense  and good judgment in this  matter. The College  has adopted  a casual  business  dress  code  but \nemphasizes that some positions may call for appropriate traditional or professional attire.  \nAdmin istrators may determine and enforce guidelines for work -place appropriate attire and \ngrooming for their areas; guidelines may limit natural or artificial scents that could be distracting \nor annoying to others.  \nIn keeping with this approach, Din\n College al lows reasonable self -expression through personal \nappearance, unless:  \n1. It conflicts with an employee’s ability to perform  his or her position effectively or with his or \nher specific work environment, or  \n2. It is regarded as offensive or harassing toward co -work ers or others with whom Din\n College \nconducts business and has contact with employees.  \nViolations of the policy can range from inappropriate clothing items to offensive perfumes and \nbody odor.  \nII. Procedures  \nWhile conducting or attending meetings, seminars, ro undtables, etc. where contact with other \nbusiness professionals may occur, appropriate professional attire and manners are recommended \nfor conducting  such business.  Appropriate  dress  and hygiene  are important  in promoting  a positive \nCollege image for its students and the general public, both internally and externally.  \n1. Administrators  are responsible  for ensuring  that their department’s  personnel  are in compliance \nwith this policy and should communicate any department -specific workplace attire and \ngrooming g uidelines to employees during new -hire orientation and evaluation periods.  \n2. If an employee comes to work in inappropriate dress, he or she will be required to go home, \nchange into conforming attire or properly groom, and return to work.  \n3. If an employee’s poor hygiene or use of too much perfume/cologne is an issue, the \nAdministrator should discuss the problem with the employee in private and should point out \nthe specific  areas  to be corrected.  If the problem  persists,  supervisors  should  follow  the normal \ncorrective action process.  \n4. Hourly  paid staff members  will not be compensated  for any work  time missed  because  of failure \nto comply with designated workplace attire and grooming standards.  \n5. All employees must carry or wear the Diné  College identification badge at all times while at \nwork.  \n6. Any questions about the department’s guidelines for attire should be discussed with the \nimmediate supervisor.  106  III.

Policy  \nThe College values its employees and students and recognizes the importance that families fulfill \nin the lives  of employees  and students.  This policy  addresses  and outlines  the circumstances  under \nwhich it is appropriate to bring non -student, minor children or other family to the workplace or \nclassroom.  \nII. Procedures  \nIn general, the workplace and the classroom are typically not appropriate places for non -student, \nminor children or other family to be present on a frequent or continuing basis. The procedures \nbelow are intended to foster respect for the needs of all parties impacted by the presence of non - \nstudent, minor children or other family on the campus, in the workpl ace, or in the classroom.  \n1. Exceptions  to this general  rule include:  \nA. Minors  or family  members  who are enrolled  as students  at the College.  \nB. Officially sponsored institutional programmatic activities for non -students and minor \nchildren with appropriate adult supervision.  \nC. Workplace assignments in which one of the conditions of the  employment is residency in \na campus facility, e.g., live -in resident hall director.  \nD. Brief visits, e.g., an employee brings his/her child, grandchild, other minor relative or \nfamily member in to introduce that him/her to co -workers, provided the employee \nsupervises the child(ren) or family member at all times during the visit.  \nE. Special occasions that are employer -sanctioned and at which attendance by children or \nother family member(s) is encouraged. Special occasions should be coordinated with and \napproved by the employee’s supervisor  after considering and satisfactorily addressing the \nfactors set forth in Part 2 below. The employee’s schedule for the special occasion should \ntake the ch ild’s or other family member’s presence into consideration.  \nF. Visits coordinated with and approved by the employee’s supervisor after considering and \nsatisfactorily addressing the factors set forth in paragraph C below. Children may be \nbrought to the workpla ce by parent employees for brief visits or other exceptional times \nwhen common sense would dictate that it is more efficient for the employee to bring the \nchild into an workplace (e.g., following or before a physician’s appointment). The parent \nemployee  must supervise  the child(ren)  on such visits  and ensure  that the child(ren)  is not \ndisruptive  to the parent  employee  or other  employees  in the workplace.  It is not appropriate \nfor non -student, minor children of any age to be in the workplace on a regular bas is, \nincluding after school each school day or on regularly scheduled school holidays.  \nG. In the event  of an emergency,  and if there  are no other  alternatives,  parent  employees  may \nhave children present in the workplace for brief periods of time provided that the parent \nobtains the immediate supervisor’s prior approval. Such arrangements are only to be \ntemporary  in nature  and may be granted only  in circumstances  where  the employee  and 108  supervisor have considered and satisfactorily addressed the fac tors set forth below. When \nauthorized, the parent employee must supervise the child(ren) at all times and should not \nleave  such child(ren)  in the custody  of another  College  employee  or student,  even  for brief \nperiods of time.  \n2. The exceptional circumstances under which children may be brought into a particular \nworkplace or classroom setting should be established in a discussion between the employee \nand supervisor taking into account the following factors:  \nA. Whether  the parent  is willing to accept  full responsibility  for the child’s  safety  and for any \ndamage to property or injury to persons that is caused by the child’s presence.  \nB. When considering the presence of children on campus, the extent to which the child’s \npresence  in the work place  creates  a potential  danger  to the child  or exposes  the department \nand the College to liability must be considered. Safety is a primary concern for parents, \nsupervisors and the College.  \nC. The extent  to which  the child’s  presence  in the workplace  or the classroom  poses  a risk of \nbreach of confidentiality with respect to information in the workplace.  \nD. The extent to which the child’s presence in the workplace or in the classroom disrupts or \nhas the potential to disrupt the work or classroom environment and/o r creates an \natmosphere  that is not conducive  to achievement  of the specific  goals  and objectives  of the \nworkplace or classroom.  \nE. Whether the parent agrees to assume responsibility for the child at all times and to ensure \nthat the child’s presence does not disrupt his/her work or interfere with the workplace or \nclassroom activities.  \nF. Whether  the parent  agrees  to supervise  the child  at all times  and agrees  that he/she  will not \nleave the child with another employee.  \nG. Such  other  factors  as the supervisor  or instructor  deems  appropriate.  \n3. The above -exceptions  are not applicable  to, and non-student,  minor  children  are not permitted \nas visitors in, work  or classroom  areas where safety and/or confidentiality factors exist unless \nprior permission from appropriate C ollege authority is obtained. Short -term visits may be \nauthorized for approved guided tours or other reasons if:  \nA. Permission  from  the appropriate  authority  is obtained.  \nB. Appropriate  precautionary  measures  are taken  and hazards  have  been  considered  or \nremoved  during the visit.  \nC. Direct  adult  supervision  of children  is required  at all times  in hazardous  areas.  \nD. Department heads  may require additional safety  measures prior to  such visits and may  \nrequire written parental consent authorizing the site visit.  \n4. Examples  of such high-risk safety  areas  generally  include,  but are not limited  to: \nA. Shops,  mechanical  rooms,  confined  spaces,  food preparation  areas;  \nB. Any areas,  indoors  or out, containing  power  tools  or machinery  with exposed  moving  parts \nor rotating equipment;  \nC. Areas  with excessive  noise,  temperatures,  inadequate  ventilation  or pollutants;  \nD. College  vehicles,  heavy  duty or other  motorized  equipment;  109  E. Any other high -risk areas (stairwells, elevators, doorways, rooftops, construction zones, \netc.);  \nF. Laboratories or specialized work areas that include chemicals, biological hazards, \nradioactive hazards, flammables, explosives, compressed gasses, sharp objects, lasers, \nresearch animals, hazardous wastes or other environmental hazards.  \nIII.

The College expects employees to follow rules of \nconduct that will protect the interests and safety of all employees and the College.  \nII. Procedures  \n1. It is the responsibility  of each employee  to conduct  all tasks  in a safe and efficient  manner,  and \nin compliance with all applicable Navajo, state and federal safety and health regulations and \nprogrammatic standards.  \n2. Safety  regulations  must  be adhered  to throughout  each department  within  the College.  It is the \nresponsibility of each employee to identify and familiarize himself or herself with the \nEmergency Plan for his/her department.  \n3. Any job -related  injury or  illness,  regardless  of severity,  must be  reported  immediately to  your \nsupervisor or safety officer for prompt and trained evaluation and medical attention.  The \nsupervisor  will complete  the safety  incident  report  and forward  it to the Department  of Human \nResources.  \n4.

Policy  \nAttendance and punctuality are very important elements of employee job performance. \nAbsenteeism places a burden on other employees who have to perform the absent employee’s job \nresponsibility. Absenteeism can cause scheduling problems for the department and can adversely \naffect the Coll ege’s ability to serve our students and to fulfill the College’s Mission. For these \nreasons, excessive absenteeism will not be tolerated.  \nII. Procedures  \nOccasionally, it is necessary to be absent or late for work due to illness or circumstances beyond \nthe empl oyee’s control.  \n1. When there is an unscheduled absence from work or tardiness, it is the responsibility of the \nemployee to call his/her supervisor within one hour of the start time.  \n2. If the supervisor is not available, it is the responsibility of the employee  to leave a voicemail \nmessage with a phone number where the supervisor can return the employee’s call.  \n3. It is the employee’s responsibility to speak to his/her supervisor personally. It is important to \nkeep the supervisor informed when the employee expects to return to work.  \n4. In the event  the employee  does not call his/her  supervisor  and misses  work  the supervisor  needs \nto take appropriate action to contact employee.  \n5. If three  (3) consecutive  days pass for employee  not reporting  to work,  the College  will consider \nthe employee have voluntarily resigned. Employees will not be paid for any \nunexcused/unauthorized absences.  \n6. In the event an employee is absent due to a medical emergency, the supervisor needs to be \ncontacted within twenty -four (24) hours. If the e mployee is not able to contact his/her \nsupervisor, an immediate family member can contact the supervisor, however the immediate \nfamily member’s notification does not mean it will be an excused absence. Upon returning to \nwork the employee must provide the s upervisor with a physician’s statement within three (3) \nbusiness days.  \nIII.

Policy  \nThe College’s Conflict of Interest policy and its related guidelines apply to all employees of the \nCollege.  The College recognizes that employees of the College perform  different functions on its \nbehalf.  A particular  outside  interest,  activity,  or relationship  that is a conflict  for one member  may \nnot be a conflict for another member due to their different areas or levels of influence on College \nbusiness.  \nTherefore, while every employee of the College community is subject to the general policy, \ndifferent  employees  of the College  community  are subject  to different  procedures  and/or  disclosure \nrequirements.  In addition,  certain  administrative  positions  and/or  units  may be subject  to additional \nguidelines, procedures, and/or disclosure requirements, consistent with the general policy.  \nHowever, the College expects its employees to conduct business according to the highest ethical \nstandards  of conduct.  Employees  are expected  to devote  their best efforts  to the best interest  of the \nCollege.  \nII. Procedures  \nEach employee of the College has an obligation to a ddress both the substance and the appearance \nof conflicts  of interest  and commitment  and, if they arise,  to disclose  them  to his/her  supervisor  and \nwithdraw  from  debate,  voting,  or other  decision -making  process  where  a conflict  of interest  exists \nor might arise.  \n1. Conflicts  of Interest  \nA conflict  of interest  may take many forms  but arises  when  an employee  of the College  might \nbe able to use the authority  of his/her  position:  a) to influence  the College’s  business  decisions \nin ways to give improper advantage or financial benefit to oneself, an immediate family \nmember;  or b) to obtain  for oneself,  a family  member,  or an associate  a financial  benefit  beyond \nthe compensation he/she is authorized to receive for performing his/her responsibilities.  \n2. Business  decisio ns \nEmployees  of the College  must  not make  or influence  business  decisions,  including  executing \npurchasing agreements or other types of contracts, from which they, a family member, or an \nassociate  may personally  benefit.  Employees  of the College  who stand  to gain from  a particular \ncontract must identify the situation to their supervisors.  \n3. Use of College  resources  and name  \nThe use of College resources (e.g., telephones, fax and duplicating machines, campus mail, \ncomputing equipment and time, staff, office an d classroom  space, supplies, vehicles, postage, \netc.) which results in personal and/or financial gain to an employee, a family member, or an \nassociate represents a conflict.  \nA. As an example,  employees  are prohibited  from  using  College  resources  for anything  other \nthan College  business.  Accordingly,  the use of the College’s  name  and seal by employees \nother than in the context of their responsibilities at the College is prohibited.  115  4. Gifts  and gratuities  \nEmployees of the College are prohibited from  soliciting personal gifts and favors from a \nvendor,  contractor,  donor,  student,  parent,  or subordinate.  Accepting  gifts is also prohibited  in \nmost circumstances.  Gifts valued in excess of $200 or of undetermined value, if not applied \nfor a College  purpose  or shared  widely,  should  be returned  immediately.  Gifts  of promotional \nitems without significant value and that are routinely distributed by vendors to clients may be \naccepted.  Ordinary business courtesies, such as payment for a modest lunch or dinner or \ncourtesy copies of professional printed matter, are also acceptable.  Gratuities or gifts of money, \nwhatever the amount, may not be accepted at any time.  \n5. Significant  financial  interests  \nEmployees of the College must disclose their significant financial inte rests in any entity that \nthey know to have business, directly or indirectly, with the College.  There are two types of \nsignificant financial interest:  \nA. Receipt  of anything  of monetary  value  from  a single  source  exceeding  $5,000 annually.  \nExamples include salary, royalties, gifts, and payments for services including consulting \nfees and honoraria.  Excluded are inheritances, and income from debt obligations  of the US, \ntribal,  state,  or local  governments,  certificates  of deposit,  blind  trusts, and broadly \ndiversified mutual funds and brokerage accounts managed by third parties.  \nB. Ownership  of an equity  interest  exceeding  the lesser  of 5% or $100,000  in any single  entity, \nexcluding US, tribal, state, or local government debt obligations, certificates of deposit, \nblind trusts,  and broadly  diversified  mutual  funds  and brokerage  accounts  managed  by third \nparties.  \n6. Perceived  conflicts  of interest : \nIn addition  to refraining  from  prohibited  activities,  employees  of the College  must  disclose  any \nactivity,  relationship,  or interest  that is, or may be perceived  to be, a conflict  of interest  so that \nthese activities, relationships, and interests can be managed properly.  \nA. Conflicts  of Commitment  \nA conflict  of commitment  occurs  when  a commitment  to activities  outside  of one’s  College \nresponsibilities interferes with an employee’s capacity to meet his/her College \nresponsibilities.  \nIt is recognized that some outside service and professional responsibilities of employees \ncan and do benefit the College.  In the case of administrativ e officers and members of the \nstaff, the time allowed for service to other organizations depends on the person’s job \nresponsibilities and his/her supervisor’s expectations for that employee’s level of \ninvolvement with professional and community organizatio ns. \nEmployees of the College must disclose any outside activity that is, or may be perceived \nto be, a conflict of commitment so that these activities can be managed properly.  \nB. Employee  Responsibilities  \nIt shall  be the responsibility  of all employees  of the College  to read the College’s  Conflict \nof Interest policy and its related guidelines and to disclose potential or actual conflicts as \nthey arise to their supervisor.  \nCollege  Administrators  are responsible  for promoting  the understanding  of and compliance \nwith the College’s Conflict of Interest policy. Employees are obligated to resolve any \nconflicts  of interest  or commitment  through  disclosure  and cooperation  with College  116  officers charged with administering this policy.  Failure to do so will b e deemed a failure \nto meet one’s obligations for which sanctions, up to and including dismissal, may be \nimposed.  \n7. Although it is not possible to specify every action that might create a conflict of interest, this \npolicy speaks to the ones which most frequen tly present problems.  If an employee has any \nquestion whether an action or proposed course of conduct would create a conflict of interest, \nhe/she should immediately contact the Department of Human Resources to obtain advice on \nthe issue.  The purpose of thi s policy is to protect employees from  any conflict of interest that \nmight arise.  \nIII. Definitions  \nThere  are no definitions  associated  with this policy.  \nIV.

Policy  \nThe College is dedicated to preparing students for lives of significant public and private \nresponsibility. Its success depends in large measure on trust in the integrity of employees. Thus, \nthe College strongly believes that an environment where employees maintain clear boundaries \nbetween personal and business interactions is most effective for conducting business.  \nThe College  is also committed  to avoiding  situations  which  may generate  complaints  of favoritism \nand sexual  harassment,  therefore,  all employees  are strongly  encouraged  to refrain  from  becoming \nromantically involved with any student.  \nII. Procedures  \n1. In the event a romantic relationship develops with a student, the employee must report the \nrelationship  to the Director  of Human  Resources  within  ten (10) working  days,  in order  to allow \nthe College to take appropriate action (including, by way of example but not limitation, a \npossible reassignment of the employee involved).  \n2. An Employee shall report immediately to his or her supervisor any past or preexisting \nconsensual relationships with a Student for whom the employee is in a position to exercise \nauthority.  \nA. Examples  include,  but are not limited  to, a Student  research  assistant,  a Student  in a current \nclass, a Student intern, or a Student advisee.  \n3. Employees who teach, coach, evaluate, allocate financial aid to or guide students over whom \nthey have professional responsibility or authority shall not engage in any dating, roma ntic or \nsexual relationships with students.  \n4. Employees who fail to report such a relationship may face disciplinary action, up to and \nincluding termination. Employees who have questions about this policy may contact the \nDirector of Human Resources.  \n5. Any empl oyee who believes they have been disadvantaged as a result of this policy or who \nbelieves this policy is not being adhered to should document his/her concerns to the Director \nof Human Resources or other designated individual.  \nIII. Definitions  \n1. Professional  Responsibility  or Authority  \nShall mean and refer to evaluating, providing oversight, supervising, academic advising, \nmentoring, coaching, counseling, providing extracurricular oversight, and/or otherwise \nparticipating in or influencing votes or decisions t hat may reward or penalize a student or \nsubordinate employee.  \n2.

This includes marriage.  120  3.

Form(s)  and/or  Equipment  \nThere  are no forms  and/or  equipment  associated  with this policy.  121  \n \nPersonnel  Policies  and \nProcedures Manual   \nWorkplace Conduct & \nExpectation:  Section  4.13 \nAdoption  Date:  07-31-2019  \nEffective  Date : 09-02-2019  \nPolicy:  Consensual  Relationships  Applicability:  All Employees  \nReference(s):  \n \nI. Policy  \nThe College  strongly  believes  that a work  environment  where  employees  maintain  clear  boundaries \nbetween  employee  personal  and business  interactions  is necessary  for effective  business  operations. \nAlthough this policy does not prohibit the development of friendships or romantic relationships \nbetween co -workers, it does establish boundaries as to how relationships are conducted during \nworking hours and within the working environment.  \nIndividuals in supervisory or Administrator roles and those with authority over others' terms and \nconditions  of employment  are subject  to more  stringent  requirements  under  this policy  due to their \nstatus as role models, their access to sensitive information, and their ability to affect the \nemployment of individuals in subordinate positions.  \nII. Procedures  \n1. During working time and in working areas, employees are expected to conduct themselves in \nan appropriate workplace manner that does not interfere with others or with overall \nproductivity.  \n2. During nonworking time, such as lunches, breaks, and before and afte r work periods, \nemployees engaging in personal exchanges in non -work areas should observe an appropriate \nworkplace manner to avoid offending other workers or putting others in an uncomfortable \nposition.  \n3. Employees  are strictly prohibited  from  engaging  in physical  contact  that would  in any way  be \ndeemed inappropriate in the workplace by a reasonable person while anywhere on College \npremises, whether during working hours or not.  \n4. Employees who allow personal relationships with co -workers to adversely affect the  work \nenvironment  will be subject  to the College's  disciplinary  policy,  including  counseling  for minor \nproblems.  Failure  to change  behavior  and maintain  expected  work  responsibilities  is viewed  as \na serious disciplinary matter.  \n5. Employee off -duty conduct is  generally regarded as private, as long as such conduct does not \ncreate problems within  the workplace. An exception to this  principle, however, is romantic or \nsexual relationships between supervisors and subordinates.  \n6. Any Supervisor, Manager, or Administra tor in a sensitive or influential position with the \nCollege must disclose the existence of a romantic or sexual relationship with another co - \nworker. Disclosure will be made to the individual's immediate supervisor and the Department \nof Human Resources. Th e Department of Human Resources will review the circumstances to \ndetermine whether any conflict of interest exists.  \n7. When  a conflict -of-interest  or potential  risk is identified  due to an employee’s  relationship  with \na co-worker, the College will work with t he parties involved to consider options for resolving \nthe problem. The initial solution may be to make sure the parties no longer work together on \nmatters where one is able to influence the other or take action for the other. Matters such as \nhiring,  firing , promotions,  performance  evaluations,  compensation  decisions  and financial  122  transactions are examples of situations that may require reallocation of duties to avoid any \nactual or perceived reward or disadvantage. In some cases, other measures  may be necessary, \nsuch as reassignment of one or both parties to other positions or departments. If one or both \nparties refuse to accept a reasonable solution, such refusal will be deemed a voluntary \nresignation.  \n8. Failure  to cooperate  with the College  to resolve  a conflict  or problem  caused  by a romantic  or \nsexual  relationship  between  co-workers  or among  managers,  supervisors  or others  in positions \nof authority in a mutually agreeable fashion may be deemed insubordination and result in \ndisciplinary action up to and including termination.  \n9. The provisions  of this policy  apply  regardless  of the sexual  orientation  of the parties  involved.  \n10. Where  doubts  exist  as to the specific  meaning  of the terms  used above,  employees  should  make \njudgments based on the overall spirit and intent of this policy.  \n11. Any concerns  about  the administration  of this policy  should  be addressed  to the Department  of \nHuman Resources.  \n12. Disclosure  under  this policy  for retaliatory  or coercive  purposes  is strictly  prohibited.  \nEmployees who fail to  report such a relationship may face disciplinary action, up to and \nincluding termination.  \n13. An employee shall report immediately any past or present consensual relationships with a \nsubordinate  Employee  over whom  the supervising  employee  exercises  authority.  An employee \nwho is the subordinate  employee  in a consensual  relationship  is also encouraged  to report  that \nrelationship to the Supervisor of the individual with whom he or she is involved.  \nIII.

Policy  \nDiné  College is  committed to  providing  a safe and healthy workplace  and to promoting the health \nand well-being  of its employees.  As such,  the following  policy  has been  adopted  and applies  to all \nemployees of Diné College.  \nIt is College policy to prohibit smoking and vaping on all College premises except for designated \nareas to provide a safe and healthy work environment for all employees.  \nII. Procedures  \nEmployees who violate this policy will be su bject to disciplinary action up to and including \ntermination.

Form(s)  and/or  Equipment  \nThere  are no forms  and/or  equipment  associated  with this policy.  124  \n \nPersonnel  Policies  and \nProcedures Manual   \nWorkplace Conduct & \nExpectation:  Section  4.15 \nAdoption  Date:  07-31-2019  \nEffective  Date : 09-02-2019  \nPolicy:  Alcohol  and Drug  Free Workplace  Applicability:  All Employees  \nReference(s):  \n \nI. Policy  \nThe College  is committed  to protecting  the safety,  health,  and well-being  of its students,  employees \nand contractors,  customers,  and its property.  Recognizing  that drug and alcohol  abuse  pose a direct \nand significant threat to these goals, as well as to productivity, the College is committed to \nproviding  a drug-free working  environment  for its students,  employees,  contractors,  customers,  and \nall those who come onto College property or utilize College services.  \nThe use of illegal drugs is inconsistent with the law -abiding behavior expected of all citizens. \nEmployees  who use illegal  drugs,  on or off duty,  tend to be less productive,  less reliable,  and prone \nto greater absenteeism, resulting in the potential for increased cost, delay, and risk.  The abuse of \nillicit  drugs  and alcohol,  on or off duty,  can impair  an employee’s  judgment  and ability  to perform \ntasks safely.  The lingering effects of drug abuse may adversely affect performance long after the \nemployee has used the drug, and can also result in accidents on duty and lapses in judgment that \ncan pose a serious  threat to health and safety.  \nII. Procedures  \nDiné College hereby prohibits the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of illicit drugs and \nalcohol by employees on the property or as part of the activities of the College.  \n1. Disciplinary  Sanctions  \nEmployees who  violate the foregoing standards of conduct shall be subjected to disciplinary \nsanctions which may include, without limitation, completion of an appropriate rehabilitation \nprogram, reprimand, probation, and suspension from employment with or without pay, \ntemporary adjustment of pay to a lower step in the assigned pay grade, demotion, and \ntermination.  Disciplinary sanctions shall be consistent with Tribal laws and College policies. \nIn addition to any disciplinary sanctions, violations may be reported to law enforcement \nauthorities for criminal prosecution. Implementation – As a matter of College policy, the \nCollege shall implement drug and alcohol abuse prevention programs which, at a minimum, \nmeet the same requirements referenced in the Drug -Free Schools and  Communities Act \nAmendments of 1989, 20 U.S.C. § 1145(g), and shall review its programs biennially to \ndetermine their effectiveness, implement changes if needed, and ensure that the sanctions \nauthorized by this policy are consistently enforced.  \n2. Alcohol  and Drug  Free Workplace  Statement  \nThe use or abuse of alcohol or illicit substances off the job which impairs to any extent \nperformance on the job is prohibited.  Employees are prohibited from reporting to work with \nalcohol  in their system  and from  bringing  any alcoholic  beverage  to the job site. A confirmed \npositive  test showing  the presence  of 0.04 percent  or more  alcohol  in the employee’s  system  is \na violation of this policy.  \nFurthermore, the use or abuse of alcohol or the unlawful manufacture, distributio n, \ndispensation,  possession  or use of a controlled  substance  in the workplace  or a College -owned \nvehicle by employees is prohibited.  As a term of his/her employment, every employee shall:  125  A. Abide  by the terms  of this Policy  Statement;  and \nB. Notify the appropriate personnel officer of any alcohol or criminal drug conviction for a \nviolation occurring in the workplace or a College -owned vehicle no later than five (5) \nworkdays  after such conviction.  Any employee  who violates  the provisions  of this Policy \nStatement shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, which may include \ntermination from employment.  \n3. Employee  Awareness  and Assistance  \nAs part of the College’s efforts to encourage employees to become or remain drug -free, \ninformation and training will be provided on an ongoing basis, as the College deems \nappropriate,  regarding  the effects  of drug and alcohol  abuse.  Materials  on drug and alcohol  use \nwill be made available to both employees and supervisors.  \nA. The College  encourages  employees  who believe  they have a problem  with alcohol  or drugs, \nlegal or illegal, to seek assistance.  Employees may contact their supervisor for assistance \nand referrals to outside professional counselors and programs for diagnosis and therapy. \nMoreover, employees may be eligible for a leave of absence to participate in such a \nprogram.  Every request for assistance will be treated as confidential, and only those \npersons with a need to know will be informed of an employee’s request.  \nB. An employee’s  decision  to seek help voluntarily  will not be used as a basis  for disciplinary \naction against the employee, although the employee may be transferred, given work \nrestrictions,  or placed  on leave,  as the College  deems  appropriate,  while  the employee  seeks \nassistance  and/or  until the employee  is drug-free and alcohol -free. An employee’s  decision \nto seek assistance  under  this policy  will be considered  voluntary  only if the employee  seeks \nassistance prior to being found in violation of this policy or being asked to take a drug \nand/or alcohol test.  \nC. A decision  to seek assistance  to address  a drug or alcohol  problem  cannot  absolve  or protect \nemployees from the consequences of substandard work performance or policy violations. \nTherefore, it is the responsibility of each employee to seek assistance before the employee’s \nalcohol or drug abuse problems lead to a violation of this or other College policies \njustifying disciplinary action.  \n4. Drug  and Alcohol  Testing  \nIn furtherance of its goal of ensuring a substance -abuse -free workplace the College has \nestablished the following drug and alcohol testing procedures.  The College requires all \nemployees and job applicants to consent urine, saliva, blood, and/or breathe samples for the \npurpose of checking for the presence of illicit drugs or alcoho l, as follows:  \nA. Job Applicants  \ni. All job applicants must take and pass a mandatory drug test as soon as practical \nfollowing their acceptance of a conditional offer of employment.  \nii. Job applicants  who test positive  for illegal  drug use will not be hired.  \niii. Job applicants  who test positive  for drugs  may re-apply  for a position  with the College \nafter 6 months  if they no longer  engage  in illegal  drug use at the time they reapply.  The \nCollege may also require proof of rehabilitation, as appropriate.  \niv. A job applicant' s refusal  to submit  to drug testing,  or attempt  to tamper  with,  substitute \nfor, adulterate, dilute, or otherwise falsify a test sample will be deemed a rejection of \nthe conditional offer of employment.  126  B. Current  Employees  \nCurrent employees are subject to reasonable suspicion testing. When any supervising \nemployee has reason to believe that an employee has violated this policy, the employee \nmay be asked  to submit  to a reasonable  suspicion  drug test. Requests  for tests will be based \nupon reasonabl y contemporaneous observations of the employee's behavior or \nperformance, or other indications that this policy may have been violated. Examples of \nwhat may trigger a request to submit to a reasonable suspicion test include, but are not \nlimited to, one or more of the following:  \ni. observed  suspected  drug or alcohol  abuse;  \nii. bizarre or erratic behavior (endangerment to self, coworkers, the College's property, \nequipment  or services  provided)  or a pattern  of conduct  that indicates  substance  abuse \nmay be a problem;  \niii. a conviction  or acceptance  of a guilty  plea for drug or alcohol  related  criminal  offenses \nduring an individual's employment with the College;  \niv. observed  possession  of alcohol,  drugs  or drug paraphernalia  on the College's  premises;  \nv. information provided by a r eliable and credible source or which is independently \ncorroborated;  \nvi. a pattern of unexplained absenteeism, tardiness, or other unexplained change in job \nperformance;  \nvii. physical  appearance  or symptoms  which  may indicate  drug or alcohol  abuse;  and/or  \nviii. a near-accident or incident where employee error appears to have played a part and it \nappears that employee impairment may have been a factor.  \nC. Post-Accident  Testing  \nThe College may ask employees who are involved in a workplace accident in which it \nappears th at that employee's error may have played a part and which results in a death, an \ninjury to any person requiring medical attention (other than first aid), and/or property \ndamage  estimated  at $1,000  or more,  to submit  to a test for drugs  and/or  alcohol  as part of \nthe investigation of the incident.  \nD. Unannounced  Testing  \nAll employees are subject to unannounced drug and/or alcohol testing and unannounced \ntesting  may be selected  at random  or by other  means,  such as by job classification  or work \nsite. \nE. Follow -up Testing  \nUnannounced follow -up testing may be required as a condition of continued employment \nduring and after an employee has participated in a treatment program for drug or alcohol \nabuse, as recommended by the employee's substance -abuse treatment provider  and \napproved by the College, for a period of up to two years.  \nF. Return -to-Work  Testing  \nEmployees who have been permitted to take leave to address drug and/or alcohol abuse \nwill be required to take and pass a drug test as a condition of returning to work.  \n5. Consequences  of a Positive  Test 127  An employee whose alcohol or drug test is positive, regardless of the reason for the test, is \nconsidered to be in violation of the College's policy and will be subject to immediate \ndisciplinary action, including termination.  \n6. Refusing  a Test \nRefusal by an employee to submit to lawfully required drug and/or alcohol testing will be \nconsidered insubordination and grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including \ntermination.  Attempts to tamper with, substitute, adu lterate, dilute, or otherwise falsify a test \nsample  are considered  equivalent  to a refusal  to submit  to a test and are grounds  for termination.  \nIII. Definitions  \n1. Illicit  Drugs  \nShall  mean  controlled  substances  listed  in Schedules  I-V of the Controlled  Substances  Act, 21 \nU.S.C. § 812, and related federal regulations, 21 C.F.R. §§ 1308.11 -1308.15, as they may be \namended from time to time and title 17, chapter 3, subchapter 10 of the Navajo Nation Code. \n“Illicit  drugs”  shall  include  controlled  substance  analogs  as defined  by federal  and Tribal  laws.  \n2.

The Provost will \nsubmit his/her compensation recommendation and attach it to the justification and submit \nthe documentation to the Department of Human Resources.  \n2. Com pensation  Changes  \nEach year, the College Administration will attempt to allocate funding for increases in \ncompensation for all faculty based on the following categories.  \nA. Increased  Cost in Benefits  \nIf the cost of mandatory  or non-mandatory  benefits  increase s, the funds  necessary  to meet \nthese  increases  are allocated  before  other  increases  in compensation  are considered.  These \nincreases may be due to increases in the College’s share of taxes and benefits, such as social \nsecurity tax, retirement, health insurance, etc.  \nB. Merit  Increases  \nThe College  may also designate  funds  for merit  increases.  This policy  is to reward  faculty \nwho have demonstrated initiative, diligence, and excellence as reflected in their \nperformance evaluations. Performance incentives are  awarded as an increase in base pay.  \nC. Adjustment  to Compensation  Ranges  \nBased on the results of periodic reviews performed by the Department of Human \nResources, the Faculty Compensation Schedule will be adjusted to keep the schedule \ncompetitive, subject to the availability of funds. Individual employee salaries will be \nreviewed by the Department of Human Resources and School Dean to determine the \nappropriate adjustment.  \nD. Change  in Grade  Due to Change  in Rank  \nIf a College faculty applies and is selected for a different rank, the faculty's new \ncompensation  will be based  on the faculty's  qualifications.  The School  Dean  uses the same \ncompensation  criteria  that would  be used if he/she  was hiring  an applicant  from  outside  the \nCollege.  \nE. Demotion  141  If a fac ulty is demoted for just cause, the employee's compensation will decrease. A \ndemoted faculty's new compensation will be determined by the School Dean.  \nF. Interim/Stewardship  Assignments  \nIt is expected that a faculty will occasionally perform duties above or b elow his/her grade \nor classification without receiving a change in salary. If an employee primarily performs \nwork  at a higher  grade  over an extended  period  of time (over  30 working  days)  the faculty \nshould be appointed to a stewardship or interim position.  \n3. Salaries  Funded  by Contracts  and Grants  \nCompensation  rate for a faculty  member  whose  position  is funded  by a grant  or contract  or paid \nfrom  multiple  accounts  shall  comply  with the Faculty  Compensation  Schedule  and are subject \nto all the provisions  of this policy.  Proposed  compensation  level  in contract  and grant  proposals \nmust comply with this policy.  \n4. Extra  Compensation  \nFaculty do not normally receive extra compensation. However, faculty may in limited \ncircumstances receive extra compensation from the College for work performed outside the \nfaculty’s  school.  Extra  compensation  is not a guarantee,  entitlement  or privilege  and is awarded \nat the sole discretion of the College.  \nExtra compensation is not intended to compensate employees for cooperative work b etween \nCollege departments and schools where faculty provide support for each other on an ongoing \nbasis. Extra compensation will not be paid for services rendered to other departments/schools \nlasting  less than a day, such as guest  speaking.  In all cases,  the employee’s  primary  assignment \ntakes priority over the work performed for another school/department.  \nTo qualify  for extra  compensation,  the additional  work  must  be performed  outside  the faculty's \nSchool, with the faculty's work being reviewed by someone  other than the faculty's regular \nsupervisor i.e. School Dean. Extra Compensation may be authorized, subject to all of the \nfollowing restrictions. The additional work (for which extra compensation is to be paid):  \nA. May not, in the opinion of the faculty's su pervisor, create a time conflict with the \nperformance of the faculty's regular duties and assignments;  \nB. May not, in the opinion of the employee's supervisor, constitute a \"conflict of interest\" \nsituation involving the faculty, such as a situation that compe tes with the interests of the \nfaculty's primary assignment or the school's interests;  \nC. Must  be short -term and, therefore,  is restricted  in both the number  or hours  worked  and the \nduration of the assignment; and  \nD. Requires advanced written approval, five (5) working days, is required by the faculty’s \nDean where the work will be performed, and the individual who will be supervising the \nadditional  work.  To request  extra  compensation,  the individual  who will be supervising  the \nadditional work must submit a justif ication memorandum with compensation amount to \nthe Department of Human Resources, which has been approved by the faculty’s School \nDean. Approval for extra compensation must be obtained before the work is performed.  \n5. Record  Keeping  \nThe School  Dean  is respons ible for keeping  records  that ensure  all extra  compensation  paid to \nfaculty is approved and paid according to the provisions of this policy.  \n6. Adjunct  Faculty  Compensation  142  Adjunct  Faculty  are compensated  at the rate of $650  per credit  hour taught.  \nIII. Definitions  \nThere  are no definitions  associated  with this policy.  \nIV. Form(s)  and/or  Equipment  \nThere  are no forms  and/or  equipment  associated  with this policy.  143  \n \nPersonnel  Policies  and \nProcedures Manual   \nCompensation:  Section  5.02 \nAdoption  Date:  07-31-2019  \nEffective  Date : 09-02-2019  \nPolicy:  Staff  and Administrator  Compensation  Applicability:  Administrators  and Staff  \nReference(s):  \n \nI. Policy  \nThe College’s compensation package consists of both financial compensation and benefits. \nBenefits have a monetary value and both the College and employee should consider this value in \ncompensation. This policy describes how administrators’ and staff employees’ starting pay is \ndetermined  and the basis  for any subsequent  pay changes.  This policy  applies  to all administrators \nand staff, but it does not apply to faculty.  \n1. The College's  compensation  administration  program  has the following  objectives:  \nA. To obtain  the highest  degree  of employee  performance  and morale  through  fair and \nequitable compensation administration.  \nB. To ensure  that salaries  paid are internally equitable  and consistent  within  and between \nposition categories.  \nC. To ensure  that salaries  paid are fair and competitive  within  the relevant  labor  market.  \nD. To provide  recognition  and reward for differences  in individual  ability  and performance.  \nE. To provide  an effective  means  of budgeting  and controlling  compensation  and related \nexpenses.  \n2. Administrator  and Staff  Compensation  Schedule  \nThe Department  of Human  Resources  assigns  each administrator  and staff job title to a specific \ngrade  and establishes  a range  of allowable  pay rates  for each grade.  Employees  will not be paid \nat a rate less than the minimum for their grade, or greater than the maximum. Compensation \nranges  are based  on compensation  rates  paid by similar  organizations  for similar  positions  and \na comparison of positions within the College. Allowable compensation rates are listed in the \nAdministrator and Staff Compensation Schedule. The compensation rates are for full -time \nemployees  and will be prorated  for part-time employees.  The Department  of Human  Resources \nwill conduct periodic reviews to preserve the accuracy and competitiveness of this schedule.  \nII. Procedures  \n1. Starting  Compensation  \nWhen hiring a new employee, the appropriate Administrator and the Department of Human \nResources will determine the employee's starting compensation prior to making a \ncompensation  offer.  The hiring  supervisor  and the Department  of Human  Resources  determine \nthe starting  compensation  based  on the grade  of the position  and the individual's  qualifications, \nincluding  experience,  as well as budgetary  considerations,  subject  to the following  provisions:  \nA. Internal  Equity  \nIf an employee  is hired  or transferred  into a department  that has one or more  employees  in \nthe same  job title, the new or transferred  employee's  starting  compensation  shall  not exceed \nthe current compensation of any employee in the department with the same job title who \nhas equivalent qualifications, including experience, and/or edu cation.  144  B. Minimum  Compensation  \nThe minimum compensation of the grade is paid to employees who meet all minimum \nqualifications of the position.  \nC. Starting  Compensation  above  the Minimum  \nA starting  compensation  above  the minimum  may be paid to employees  who have  directly \nrelated qualifications beyond the minimum requirements for the position. These \nqualifications include, but are not limited to, directly related experience at a comparable \nlevel or higher, education, certifications, and licenses.  \nD. Starting  Compensation  above  the Midpoint  \nTo pay a starting compensation at or above the midpoint of the compensation range, the \nhiring Administrator must submit a written justification to the appropriate Vice President \nfor approval. The Vice President wil l submit his/her compensation recommendation and \nattach it to the justification and submit the documentation to the Department of Human \nResources.  \n2. Compensation  Changes  \nEach year, the administration allocates funds for increases in compensation for all empl oyees \nbased on the following categories.  \nA. Increased  Cost of Benefits  \nIf the cost of mandatory  or non-mandatory  benefits  increases,  the funds  necessary  to meet \nthese  increases  are allocated  before  other  increases  in compensation  are considered.  These \nincreases may be due to increases in the College’s share of taxes and benefits, such as social \nsecurity tax, retirement, health insurance, etc.  \nB. Merit  Increases  \nThe College may also designate funds for merit increases. This policy is to reward \nadministrator s and staff who have demonstrated initiative, diligence, and excellence as \nreflected  in their performance evaluations. Each  year budgetary  guidelines will determine \nif funds are available and the lower and upper limits for such increase. Performance \nincent ives are awarded as an increase in base pay.  \nC. Adjustments  to the Compensation  Ranges  \nBased on the results of periodic reviews performed by the Department of Human \nResources, the Administrator and Staff Compensation Schedule will be adjusted to keep \nthe schedule competitive,  subject  to the availability  of funds.  Individual  employee  salaries \nwill be reviewed by the Department of Human Resources to determine the appropriate \nadjustment.  \nD. Change  in Grade  Due to Change  in Position  \nIf a College employee applies and is selected for a different position, the employee's new \ncompensation will be based on the employee's qualifications. The appropriate \nAdministrator in consultation with the Director of Human Resources uses the same \ncompensation  criteria  that would  be used if he/she  was hiring  an applicant  from  outside  the \nCollege.  \nE. Demotion  145  If an employee is demoted, with cause, the employee's compensation will decrease.  A \ndemoted employee's new compensation will be determined by the supervisor in \nconsultation with the Department of Human Resources.  \nF. Reclassification  \nReclassification  of a position  to a higher  grade  may result  from  the Department  of Human \nResources  changing  the position  due to market  changes  or from  significant  changes  in the \nposition's duties and responsibilities. The salary for the reclassified position will be \nrecalculated accordingly. If a position is changed to a different grade, the resulting \ncompensation change will be effective as soon as the next pay period after t he employee \nhas been notified in writing of the compensation change. In addition, an employee may \nchoose to exercise priority hiring rights for any vacant position in the previously held \nclassification.  \nG. Stewardship  or Interim  Appointments  \nIt is expected th at an employee will occasionally perform duties above or below his/her \ngrade or classification without receiving a change in salary. If an employee primarily \nperforms work at a higher grade over an extended period of time (over 30 working days) \nthe employe e should be appointed to a stewardship or interim position.  \n3. Pay Differential  \nA. Pay Rate for Shift  Work  \nA pay differential is an hourly pay rate in addition to a non -exempt employee's base pay \nrate. A pay differential is paid to an employee for a shift assign ment when at least half of \nthe work  hours  are between  4:30 P.M.  and 8:00 A.M.  of the following  day. Pay differential \nrates apply to the entire work period and not just the hours between 4:30 P.M. and 8:00 \nA.M.  \nOvertime  is calculated  at the employee's  regular  rate of pay (base  pay plus pay differential). \nPay differential rates are established by the Department of Human Resources. Exempt \nemployees are not paid a pay differential.  \nB. On-Call Pay \nOn call pay is paid to non-exempt  employees  who are required  to remain  available  to return \nto work and who meet the conditions for payment pursuant to this policy. Generally, on \ncall time is compensable  when  employees  are so restricted  that they cannot  pursue  personal \nactivities.  The specific  factors  considered  to determine  if on call status  is compensated  are: \ni. Restrictions  on the employee's  location,  \nii. Expected  response  time to return  to work,  \niii. Number  of other  employees  available  to be called,  \niv. Frequency  and urgency  of calls received,  and \nv. Actual  use of on-call time.  \nThe basis for determining if time in on -call status is compensated is the extent to which \nemployees are actually inconvenienced. Therefore, employees who are free to leave the \npremises and attend to personal matters are not typically compensated for time i n on-call \nstatus. Carrying a beeper or leaving a phone number where one can be reached does not \nrequire compensation unless the conditions listed above are also met.  146  The employee’s Administrator  determines (1)  when  on-call status  is compensat ed time and \n(2) the rate non -exempt employees will be paid in consultation with the Department of \nHuman Resources. Exempt employees do not receive on -call pay.  \n4. Extra  Compensation  for Exempt  Employees  \nExempt  employees  do not normally  receive  extra  compensation.  However,  exempt  employees \nmay in limited  circumstances  receive  extra  compensation  from  the College  for work  performed \noutside the employee’s department.  Extra compensation is not a guarantee, entitlement or \nprivilege and is awarded at the sol e discretion of the College.  \nA. Extra compensation is not intended to compensate employees for cooperative work \nbetween College departments where staff provide support for each other on an ongoing \nbasis. Extra compensation will not be paid for services render ed to other departments \nlasting less than a day, such as guest speaking. In all cases, the employee’s primary \nassignment takes priority over the work performed for another department.  \nB. To qualify for extra compensation, the additional work must be performed  outside the \nemployee's department, with the employee's work being reviewed by someone other than \nthe employee's regular supervisor.  \nC. Restrictions on the Authorized Use of Extra Compensation – Extra compensation may be \nauthorized,  subject  to all of the following  restrictions.  The additional  work  (for which  extra \ncompensation is to be paid):  \ni. may not, in the opinion of the employee's supervisor, create a time conflict with the \nperformance of the employee's regular duties and assignments;  \nii. may not, in the opinion  of the employee's  supervisor,  constitute  a \"conflict  of interest\" \nsituation involving the employee, such as a situation that competes with the interests \nof the employee's primary assignment or the department's interests; and  \niii. must  be short -term and, therefore,  is restricted  in both the number  or hours  worked  and \nthe duration of the assignment.  \nD. Required  Approval  \nAdvance written approval is required by the employee's immediate supervisor where the \nwork will be performed, and the individual who will be supervising the additional work. \nTo request  extra  compensation,  the individual  who will be supervising  the additional  work \nmust  submit  a justification  memorandum  with compensation  amount  to the Department  of \nHuman Resources, which has been approved by the employee’s Administrator. Approval \nfor extra compensation must be obtained before the work is performed.  \nE. Pay Rate for Extra  Compensation  \nAn employee  Additional  Pay Agreement  may be issued  for employees  and shall  be subject \nto approval of the President.  The services for which the employee is receiving additional \npay shall be clearly outside the employee’s normal scope of duties and responsibilities as \ndescribed in the employee’s position description and regularly scheduled tour of duty. \nAdditional earnings s hall be added to the employee’s regular paycheck and are subject to \ndeductions for income taxes, FICA and FUTA.  \nWhen extra compensation is authorized, the rate of pay is determined by the Department \nof Human  Resources  and must  be in accordance  with the College’s  compensation  scale  for \nthe type of work being done and reflect the amount of effort involved.  For example, if a \nmanager  does the job of an accountant,  the extra  compensation  paid to the manager  would \nbe at the rate of pay an accountant  would  be paid for the job. However,  if an accountant  147  does accounting duties in another department, the accountant's pay rate would remain the \nsame.  If no comparable  job classification  exists  or the department  is not sure of the proper \npay rate, the department making payment should contact the Department of Human \nResources for a pay rate determination.  \nAfter the work is completed, the employee and the individual supervising the work must \nsign the Non-Standard  Payment  form  verifying  the work  has been  completed  and submit  it \nto the finance  office  for processing.  The employee  will be paid on the next regular  payroll \nafter the payroll office receives the confirmation of completion of work. Any changes to \nthe Non -Standard Payment form after approval may need to be approved by the \nDepartment of Human Resources and/or the respective vice president.  \n5. Record  Keeping  \nThe appropriate Administrator is responsible for keeping records that ensure all extra \ncompensation paid to employees is approved and paid accordi ng to the provisions of this policy.  \n6. Salaries  Funded  by Contracts  and Grants  \nAdministration  and staff employees  whose  salaries  are funded  by contracts  or grants  are subject \nto all the provisions of this policy. Proposed compensation levels in contract and grant \nproposals must comply with this policy.  \n7. Overtime  \nThe purpose of this policy is to control labor costs by managing the expense of overtime pay \nto non -exempt employees. Exempt employees are not eligible for overtime.  \nA. Compliance  \nThe College will pay 150  percent to non -exempt employees who exceed forty hours of \nwork time in a workweek.  \ni. Paid leave,  such as holiday,  sick or annual  leave,  does not apply  toward  work  time.  \nii. The work week begins at 12:00 a.m. on Saturday morning and ends at 11:59 p.m. on \nFriday night.  \niii. Overtime payments do not commence until the employee exceeds 40 hours in a work \nweek.  \nB. Overtime  Approval  \nNon-exempt employees are required to obtain approval from supervisors prior to the use \nof overtime.  Employees  who anticipate  the need  for overtime  to complete  the week’s  work \nmust notify the supervisor in advance and obtain approval prior to working hours that \nextend  beyond  their normal  schedule.  Although  overtime  payments  do not commence  until \nthe employee exceeds 40 hours in a workweek, approval is required.  \nC. Mandatory  Overtime  \nDuring  busy  periods,  a supervisor  may require  employees  to work  extended  hours.  \nD. Consequences  of Overuse  of Overtime  \nSupervisors are required to obtain approval from their appropriate Administrator prior to \nauthorizi ng non -exempt employees to work overtime.  Supervisors who authorize non - \nexempt employees to work overtime without prior approval from the appropriate \nAdministrator  will be subject  to disciplinary  action.  Supervisors  who continually  rely on 148  the use of overtime  hours  in order  to complete  a week’s  work  without  authorization  by the \nappropriate Administrator will be placed on a performance improvement plan.  \nE. Consequences  of Unauthorized  Overtime  \nEmployees who fail to obtain approval prior to worki ng hours that extend beyond their \nnormal 40 -hour workweek will be paid overtime payments for the time worked in excess \nof 40 hours, but will be subjected to disciplinary action. Repeated offenses may result in \ntermination.  \n8. Compensatory  Time  \nCompensatory  time refers  to compensation,  taken  as time off with pay, for hours  an employee \nworks in addition to his/her normal work schedule. Supervisors may allow non -exempt \nemployees to take compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay in accordance with the \nprovisions of this policy. The provisions for compensatory time for non -exempt employees \ndiffer from the guidelines for exempt employees.  \nA. Non-Exempt  Employees  \nSupervisors  are responsible  for ensuring  compliance  with this policy  and should  ensure  an \nemploye e is compensated for overtime hours. Non -exempt employees may be granted \ncompensatory  time if there  is a written  agreement,  in advance,  between  the supervisor  and \nthe employee to use compensatory time in lieu of overtime pay. If an employee does not \nwant  compensatory  time in lieu of overtime  pay, the employee  must  be paid overtime.  This \ndecision may not be used as a factor in determining which employee to assign to work \novertime.  \nAll hours worked must be reported on the employee's time sheet. Compensatory hours \nearned and used must be thoroughly documented. Departments should use the \nCompensatory Time Report Form.  \ni. Non-exempt  employees  earn compensatory  time at the same  rate as overtime,  normally \n150 percent the number of overtime hours worked. However, if t he additional hours \nworked  do not qualify  as overtime  (i.e. leave  was taken  during  the work  week),  but the \nemployee wants time off in lieu of payment; such compensatory time will be accrued \nat the straight time rate.  \nii. Non-exempt employees may accrue a maxim um of 120 hours of compensatory time. \n(80 hours of overtime worked x 1.5 = 120 hours of compensatory time.)  \niii. Compensatory time must be used within ninety (90) calendar days from the date it is \nearned. Compensatory time that is not used within ninety (90) ca lendar days must be \nconverted to overtime pay. Employees working on a contract or grant may earn \ncompensatory  time in accordance  with the terms  of the contract  or grant,  if authorized \nby the supervisor  in advance,  and must  take compensatory  time within  ninety  (90) days \nor the period covered by the contract or grant, whichever is less. Compensatory time \nthat is not used within the required time period must be converted to overtime pay.  \niv. Non-exempt employees separating from the College will be paid for any unused \ncompensatory time.  \nv. Each department will maintain records of compensatory time earned and used by its \nnon-exempt employees.  \nB. Exempt  Employees  149  Exempt  employees  are paid a regular  compensation  and are not paid based  on the number \nof hours worked. Exempt employees are hired to get the job done and at times may need to  \nwork  beyond  their usual  schedule.  Exempt  employees  are given  the flexibility  to exercise \njudgment  both in how and when  the work  is done.  A greater  emphasis  is placed  on meeting  \nthe responsibilities of the position rather than on working a specific number of hours. \nExempt employees are expected to meet operational needs and are evaluated on results \nachieved. Therefore, exempt employees do not accrue compensatory time in the same \nmanner as non -exempt employees.  \nHowever,  supervisors  may allow  an exempt employee  paid time off when  it is recognized \nthat the exempt  employee  has worked  a significant  amount  of time beyond  the normal  work \nschedule to perform specific job requirements. Any  time off under the circumstances \ndescribed  above  shall  be determined  mutually  by the supervisor  and employee.  An exempt \nemployee may not use this time off for absences when the employee is paid for work \nperformed  outside  the employee's  regular  work  hours  or outside  the College.  The employee \nmust use annual leave for such absences.  \nAdministrators will administer compensatory time in a fair and reasonable manner. An \nexempt employee is responsible for ensuring procedural compliance with this policy and \nadequate  documentation  of absences.  Exempt  employees  separating  from  the College  will \nnot be paid for any unused  compensatory  time and are not eligible  to extend  their separation \ndate to use such time off.  \nIII. Definitions  \nThere  are no definitions  associated  with the policy  \nIV. Form(s)  and/or  Equipment  \n1. Compensatory  Time  Report  Form  150  \n \nPersonnel  Policies  and \nProcedures Manual   \nCompensation:  Section  5.03 \nAdoption  Date:  07-31-2019  \nEffective  Date : 09-02-2019  \nPolicy:  College  Bonus  Plan Applicability:  All Employees  \nReference(s):  \n \nI. Policy  \nThe goal of the Diné  College’s  Bonus  Plan is to provide  a one-time bonus  to employees  who have \naccomplished  extraordinary  achievement(s)  within  the workplace.  It is designed  to complement  the \nEvaluation Program and provide a financial reward to a select few who have outperformed and \nexceeded expectations during the year.  \nII. Procedures  \n1. Eligibility  \nAll regular full -time employees and regular part -time (exempt and non -exempt) are eligible. \nStudent employees, contract staff , and temporary employees are not eligible to participate.  \n2. Criteria  \nEligible  employees  may be considered  for a bonus  based  on the following  criteria:  \nA. The employee  performed  substantially  above  and beyond  expectations  on a specific  project \nor goal; or  \nB. The employee  made  a contribution  that has a significant  impact  on the College,  school,  or \ndepartment objectives; or  \nC. The employee went above and beyond the normal responsibilities required by his/her \nposition;  or the staff member  assumed  added  responsibilities  in the short -term to address  a \nsituation in which there was a \"gap\" in the organization.  \n3. Performance  Measures  \nA. The performance of the employee must be extraordinary, above normal expectations, and \nbeyond the basic functions of their job. Everyone is paid to  do their job; adequacy of \nperformance does not establish eligibility for  a bonus. Extraordinary achievement may be \nindicated  by a single  noteworthy  action  or a succession  of extra  efforts  accomplished  over \na period  of time.  The performance  must  be measurable  and have  a beneficial  net effect  for \nthe College. The written recommendation must be very specific and quantify exactly the \neffort and the outcome.  \nB. Payments under this policy may not relate in any way to success in securing student \nenrollments or awarding financial aid. Such payments are not supported by Diné College \nand would violate federal law and the Department of Education regulations:  \nSection 48 7(a) (20) of the Higher Education Act (34 U.S.C. § 668.14(b) (22) prohibits \nschools that receive Title IV student aid funds from providing any commission, bonus, or \nother  incentive  payment  based  directly or  indirectly on  success  in securing  enrollments  or \nfinancial aid to any person or entities engaged in any student recruiting or admission \nactivities or in making decisions regarding the award of student financial assistance.  \nC. Each  Department  will maintain  on record  discrete  and specific  measures,  benchmarks  and \nstandards  of operation  to identify  circumstances  that would  establish  that an employee  has 151  met the criteria  in section  II.2. above.  These  measures  should  fall into one of the following \ncategories:  \ni. Customer  Service:  Vendor,  Student,  Faculty,  Staff;  Customer  Satisfaction  of \ntimeliness, courtesy, quality, etc.  \nii. Operational  Excellence:  Productivity,  Growth,  Quality,  Cost Containment  \n4. Nomination  Process  \nAn employee may be nominated by any Diné  College Administrator. Nominations should be \nsent to employee's  supervisor,  department/school  administrator,  and vice president  for review.  \nA. After the employee's nomination has been reviewed in their department, the nomination \nshould be sent to the Directo r of Human Resources.  \nB. The College  Bonus  Plan Committee  will make  a final decision  after considering  all \ncomments.  \nC. The Department  of Human  Resources  will track  all nominations.  \nD. The recommendation should be submitted on the form and include a concise statement in \nthree or four sentences presenting the case for bonus qualification.  Please give careful \nconsideration and justification to your recommendation/s.  \n5. Committee  \nThe College  Bonus  Plan Committee  is comprised  of the Provost,  Vice  President  of Financ e & \nAdministration, Vice President of Student Affairs, Vice President of External Affairs, the \nDirector of Human Resources and the College President  \n6. Bonus  Award  \nA. Bonuses  shall  be determined  as a percentage  of base pay. \nB. Bonuses  may be awarded  throughout  the year based  on events/situations.  \nC. An employee  may not receive  more  than one bonus  per fiscal  year.  \n7. Disclaimer  \nThe bonus  under  this plan will not be used in calculating  retirement,  health  or wellness  benefits. \nThe bonus is to be considered to be a one -time cash award and is not to be added to the base \npay of the individual. All bonus earnings are considered taxable income in the year in which \nthey are paid.  Appropriate  federal  and state income  taxes  will be withheld  at the rates  in effect \nat the time of the payout.  Participants  are responsible  for determining  the tax consequences  of \nthe bonus payments and arranging for appropriate withholding. Diné College will not be \nresponsible for payments, interest, penalties, costs or expenses incurred as a result of an \nemployee's failure to arrange for sufficient withholding of deductions from bonus payments. \nAn employee must be considered active on the bonus payout date to receive any bonus under \nthis plan. At  any point in time, Diné College reserves the right to  unilat erally change, modify, \nand/or terminate any aspect of this plan.  \nIII.

Nomination  Form  152  \n \nPersonnel  Policies  and \nProcedures Manual   \nCompensation:  Section  5.04 \nAdoption  Date:  07-31-2019  \nEffective  Date : 09-02-2019  \nPolicy:  Holiday  Compensation  Applicability:  All Employees  \nReference(s):  \n \nI. Policy  \nThe College  observes  specific  holidays  each year and most  offices  are closed  during  these  holidays. \nThis policy describes which staff employees are eligible for holiday pay, calculation of holiday \npay, and compensation  to staff employees  who must  work  on a holiday.  Although  the College  does \nnot grant  holiday  pay for holidays  other  than the observed  holidays  listed  below,  an employee  who \nrequests time off to observe a religious  holiday will be allowed to do so by taking annual leave or \nleave without pay.  \nThe following  holidays  are observed  by the College:  \nNew  Year’s  Day January  1 \nMartin  Luther  King  Day Third  Monday  in January  \nDiné College Day   Fourth Monday in April \nDiné College Memorial Day  Friday  before  Memorial  Day \nMemorial Day  Last Monday in May  \nIndependence  Day July 4 \nSih Hasin  Day Friday  before  Faculty  Return  in August  \nLabor  Day First Monday  in September  \nIndigenous  People’s  Day Second  Monday  in October  \nVeteran’s  Day November  11 \nThanksgiving  Day Fourth  Thursday  in November  \nDiné  Family  Day Friday  immediately  following  Thanksgiving  Day \nChristmas  Eve December  24 \nChristmas  Day December  25. \n1. Holidays  Falling  on a Weekend  \nThe holiday  is usually  observed  on the calendar  day designated  as the holiday.  When  a holiday \nfalls on a Saturday, the holiday will normally be observed on the preceding Friday. When a \nholiday falls on a Sunday, the holiday will normally be observ ed on the following Monday. \nThe College reserves the right to schedule a holiday that falls on Saturday or Sunday on the \nday that most benefits the harmonious operation of the College.  \n2. Employees  Eligible  for Holiday  Pay \nOnly regular full -time and regular part-time employees (working 20 or more hours per week) \nare eligible  to be paid for holiday  time off. Employees  must  either  work  or be on paid leave  on \nscheduled  work  days before  and/or  after the holiday  in order  to be eligible  for holiday  pay. 153  Temporary  employees  and/or  student  employees  are not eligible  to receive  pay for holiday  time \noff. \n3. Holiday  Compensation  \nHoliday  pay for non-exempt  staff working  a traditional  full-time Monday  – Friday  schedule  is \ncalculated based on their regularly scheduled hours. If the employee is scheduled to work any \nother  schedule  (part -time,  flex etc.),  the employee  will be paid for the number  of hours  obtained \nby dividing  their normal  number  of scheduled  weekly  work  hours  by 5 days for each observed \nholiday.  \nFor example, an employee who normally works 30 hours per week would receive 6 hours of \nholiday pay or 30 hours divided by 5 days which equals 6 hours. At no time will non -exempt \nemployees receive greater than 8 hours of holiday pay, regar dless of schedule. In any month \ncontaining holidays, exempt staff will receive their normal pay, while managing their time \nappropriately to ensure completion of all assigned duties.  \n4. Employees  Required  to Work  on a Holiday  \nDepartments such as, law enforceme nt, security, libraries, information services and plant \nmaintenance,  due to the nature  of their operation,  may regularly  require  employees  to work  on \nholidays. Each employee affected should be advised that this alternate holiday schedule is a \ncondition of employment.  \nA. To meet operational needs, an employee may be required to work a holiday without such \nnotice  and approval.  In these  situations,  supervisors  should  give employees  as much  notice \nas possible.  \nB. Supervisors  will assign  employees  to work  holidays  in a fair and reasonable  manner,  taking \ninto consideration the needs of the department, and the abilities, availability, and \nwillingness of employees. An employee who refuses to work a holiday may be subject to \ndisciplinary action.  \nC. Non-exempt Employees who ar e required to work on a holiday will be paid for the hours \nworked at a premium rate of 1.5 times their regular rate and will also be given time off in \nlieu of the holiday. If a non -exempt employee does not take the time off during this time \nperiod  or separ ates from  the College  before  the time off is taken  the employee  will be paid \nfor all unused  holiday  leave  at straight  time.  Employees  required  to work  on a holiday,  who \ncannot  be given  a day off in lieu of the holiday,  will be paid the premium  rate 1.5 times  for \nthe hours  worked  on the holiday.  In addition,  they will receive  holiday  pay at their regular \nrate of pay.  \nD. In most instances exempt employees will not be required to work on a holiday. Exempt \nemployees who are required to work on a holiday will be  paid their regular compensation \nand given another day off.  \nII.

Policy  \nFrom  time to time some  employees  must  perform  hazardous  duties  or duties  in hazardous  locations, \nor both.  The College  recognizes  that employees  must  be compensated  for their willingness  to take \non hazardous duties.  \nDuring periods when the College declares an emergency, employees who are deemed essential \nworkers are required report to work on site.  If the  College President, pursuant to Section 1.14, \ndeems  that the emergency  is one creating  conditions  such that the essential  worker’s  health  or safety \nis placed at risk, the College will take reasonable available measures to protect essential workers \nwhile th ey carry out “hazardous duty.”  \nIn addition, there may be circumstances even where an emergency declaration is not warranted \nwhere an employee must perform hazardous duties.  \nIn either  case,  employees  carrying  out hazardous  duties  are eligible  for hazard  duty pay (HDP).  All \nfull- and part-time employees  assigned  to positions  that require  them  to carry  out “hazardous  duty” \nare eligible for hazardous duty pay. Hazard Duty Pay (HDP) is a supplement to the employee’s \nbase pay.  \nNote:  According  to the Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS),  HDP  is considered  taxable  income.  These \namounts will be included on the employee’s W -2. \nII. Procedures  \nWorkers  carrying  out hazardous  duties  will be compensated  a HDP  as follows:  \n1. Employees carrying out hazardous duties will begin earning  the pay differential beginning on \nthe first day of the assignment of such duties.  HDP will be prorated based on the number of \nhours carrying out such hazardous duties.  \n2. HDP is paid as a percentage of the employee base pay. The College will pay HDP employee s \nan additional  percentage  of their base pay based  on the kind of hazardous  duty assigned  to the \nemployee as set forth in 5 CFR Appendix -A_to_subpart_I_of_part_550. By utilizing this \nAppendix as a reference, the College is not adopting any federal obligation otherwise not \napplicable to it.  \n3. Neither overtime, holiday pay nor any other premium pay is factored into the base rate to \ndetermine the HDP rate.  \n4. HDP will not be paid when the employee is on an unpaid leave of absence or on paid leave \naway  from  the assigned  location.  HDP  will resume  when  the employee  returns  to the assigned \nlocation.  \nIII. Definitions  \n1. Hazardous  Duty  \nMeans  duty performed  under  circumstances  in which  an accident  could  result  in serious  injury \nor death,  such as duty performed  on a high structure  where  protective  facilities  are not used or 156  being exposed to micro -organic materials, which when introduced into the body are likely to \ncause serious disease or fatality and for which protective devices do not afford complete \nprotec tion. \nIV.

Policy  \nIn the event  of an involuntary  termination  due to a reduction  in force/layoff,  change  in the College’s \ndirection, or job elimination, \n a severance benefit for affected employees. \nDiné  College offers this severance pay in accord with its vision to operate in line with Navajo \ntradition and help ease the employee’s transition, should a layoff or other covered termination \noccur.  \nII. Conditions  for Severance  Benefit  \n1. “Continuous service” include s leave time or other time off taken for any purpose recognized \nunder  College  policy  or applicable  law, as well as any break  in service  recognized  as continuous \nservice under College policy or applicable law.  \n2. “Continuous service with the College” includes service as an employee of the College in any \ncapacity at a regular full -time status, except that it does not include employment as a student \nemployee. Time of service is not counted more than once where an employee works \ncontemporaneously in two or more po sitions with the College.  \n3. Receipt  of severance  pay under  this policy  does not affect  a covered  employee’s  eligibility  for \nretiree benefits, as applicable.  \n4. Employees  still under  probation  or have  not completed  one-year of continuous  service  are not \neligible.  \n5. This Policy does not apply to termination for cause, resignation, refusal to be reassigned, \nreclassified  or refusal  to be relocated.  This policy  applies  to all exempt  and nonexempt,  regular \nfull-time employees.  \nIII. Procedures  \nSubject to the coverage provisions and conditions set forth in this policy, a covered employee is \neligible  for the severance  pay below,  if on the date of his or her separation  from  the College,  he or \nshe is classified  as a regular  full-time employee  and has completed at  least one year of continuous \nservice in that capacity.:  \n1. Non-Administrators  \nTwo full weeks  of severance,  at the employee’s base  pay, less legally  required  deductions,  for \neach full year of continuous service with the College up to a total maximum of 50 weeks of \nseverance pay.  \n2.

For the purposes of calculation, faculty’s weekly severance will be \ndetermined by the salary per academic year divided by forty (40) weeks.  158  For example:  $50,000  per Academic  Year  with 5 academic  years  of continuous  service.  \n$50,000/40  weeks  = $1,250  per week.  At five years  = 5 x 1.5 x $1,250  = $9,375  \n3. Administrators  \nOne full week of severance, at his or her base pay, less deductions permitted by law, for each \nfull year of continuous  service  with the College  up to a total maximum  of 25 weeks  of severance \npay. \nIV.

Tuition  Waiver  Form  163  \n \nPersonnel  Policies  and \nProcedures Manual   \nBenefits:  Section  6.03 \nAdoption  Date:  07-31-2019  \nEffective  Date : 09-02-2019  \nPolicy:  Career  Development  Applicability:  All Employees  \nReference(s):  \n \nI. Policy  \nThe College is committed to recruiting qualified applicants and retaining the best qualified \nemployees to successfully fulfill  and carry out  the College’s mission.  This policy  describes career \ndevelopment programs designed to prepare employees to meet the challenges of the workplace. \nThe College  will provide  these  career  development  opportunities  and the support  necessary,  subject \nto available funding and applicable policies. E mployees are responsible for taking advantage of \nthese opportunities and being competitive in their chosen careers.  \nIt is understood  that career  development  and job skills  acquisition  are the joint responsibility  of the \nemployee, the supervisor and the employing department. Supervisors are expected to consult \nannually with direct reports to develop an appropriate staff development strategy.  \nCareer  development  programs  provide  staff with opportunities  for lifelong  learning  and continuous \nself-improvement.  Career development encourages growth and commitment from employees to \nenhance  job satisfaction  and productivity.  Supervisors  are responsible  for assisting  employees  with \ntheir career development.  \nII. Procedures  \n1. Types  of Career  Development  Opportunities  \nA. Career  Ladders  \nCareer  ladders  are an avenue  for staff to advance  in their career  at the College.  As defined \nhere, a career ladder is a non -competitive opportunity that an employee and his/her \nsupervisor negotiate to allow the employee to advance to a higher grade while remaining \nin the same position. Career ladders must be approved in advance by the Department of \nHuman Resources. Not every position lends itself to career ladder movement and even \nthose that do may have limited progression available. However, w here possible, career \nladders provide a valuable opportunity for both the employee’s and the College’s \ndevelopment. Career ladders differ from career advancement, in that there does not have \nto be a position vacancy for career ladder progression.  \nThe prima ry criteria  for advancement  through  a career  ladder  is the ability  of a position  to \ninclude  more  complex  duties  and qualifications  as stated  in the job description  for the next \nlevel in the career path. A career ladder plan will list the specific requireme nts necessary \nfor advancement to the next level. These requirements usually include completion of \neducation, professional certification/licenses, and/or specific experience. Before an \nemployee can be advanced to the next level, the employee must meet these  requirements \nand show the ability to satisfactorily perform increased responsibilities.  \nCareer ladders differ depending on the positions and fields involved. A written career \nladder  plan must  be developed  and signed  in advance  by the  employee,  administrator,  and \nappropriate Vice President. The plan must include a proposed timeline and proposed \ncompensation increase specific to the career ladder and employee. The employee's \nproposed  compensation  will be based  on the employee's  additional  qualific ations  using  the \nsame  criteria  that would  be used if the next level  position  were  filled  through  recruitment.  164  If the needs  of the employee  or department  change  significantly,  the career  plan may need \nto be revised.  Individual  career  ladder  plans  must  be approved  by the Department  of Human \nResources to ensure the criteria for advancement are reasonable and consistent with \nestablished  job descriptions.  A copy  of the signed  career  ladder  plan must  be filed with the \nDepartment of Human Resources . \nThe Department of Human Resources will monitor career ladder and career advancement \nactivity and distribute an annual report of participation in these programs to the campus.  \nB. Job Enrichment  Through  Job Sharing  \nJob enrichment plans expand employee skills by providing employees with opportunities \nto learn different job duties through activities such as cross -training or job rotation. Job \nenrichment results in better trained employees and the variety and challenge of new \nassignments  improves  morale  and reduc es turnover.  Not every  position  allows  for a change \nin job duties; however, to the extent possible, supervisors are encouraged to provide job \nenrichment opportunities to employees. Job enrichment plans shall be developed and \nrecorded  in the performance  evaluation  process.  Successful  completion  of a job enrichment \nplan does not result  in immediate  job advancement  to a higher  pay grade,  but may result  in \na merit pay increase within the current pay grade.  \nC. Professional  Development  and Training  \nAll employees benefit from and are expected to participate in some form of occupational \nand/or professional education and training on an ongoing basis to ensure they keep up to \ndate with their fields  of expertise.  Occupational  and/or  professional  education  and training \ncome in many forms such as academic classes, workshops/seminars, annual conferences, \ndistance education, books/journals, specific training courses, membership in professional \nassociations, and electronic discussion groups. For career development and advanc ement \nprograms to be successful, training and support services for employees, supervisors, and \nmanagers are essential. Departments must pay for career development activities required \nby supervisors such as required training for licenses and certifications,  or commitments \nmade on an employee's performance evaluation. Departments are also encouraged to pay \nfor other career development activities with a fair and reasonable distribution of available \nresources.  \nThe supervisor's performance management responsibil ity includes helping employees \nidentify  career  development  opportunities  at the College.  Supervisors  will include  in every \nemployee's performance evaluation a discussion of the College's career development \nprogram  and will work  with each employee  to develo p an appropriate  career  development \nplan that uses one or more of the programs described in this policy for the coming year. \nSupervisors will offer career development opportunities in a fair, reasonable, and \nnondiscriminatory manner. Managers and supervisors will participate in the programs \ndescribed in this policy and will be evaluated on their efforts to develop staff. The \nDepartment  of Human  Resources  offers  training  sessions  for managers  and supervisors  on \nhow to assist their employees with car eer development.  \niii. Career  Development  Programs  \nAll employees  are encouraged  to participate  in some  form  of career  development.  The \nCollege's  career  development  programs  consist  of the following  opportunities  that can \nstand alone or be combined with each othe r: \na. continuous occupational and/or professional education and training to maintain \nexpertise;  165  b. job enrichment opportunities which expand skills through learning different job \nduties; and  \nc. career  ladders  to provide  for planned  progression  within  the same  position.  \niv. Employee  Career  Development  Workshop  \nEmployees interested in enhancing their careers at the College may take career \ndevelopment  workshops  offered  by the Department  of Human  Resources.  A schedule \nof workshops and seminars will be distributed quarterly to employees.  In addition, \nwhen employees complete the probationary period they will be notified by the \nDepartment of Human Resources about career development programs.  \nv.

Policy  \nAll employees are covered by workers’ compensation insurance which compensates an employee \nfor lost time arising out of a work -related injury. Employees must report any accident or  injury \nimmediately to their supervisor so that the necessary paperwork is completed.  \nAll employees who are full -time temporary, part -time temporary, regular full -time, and regular \npart-time are eligible  for Workers’  Compensation.

Policy  \nTelecommuting  allows  employees  to work  at home,  on travel  or in a satellite  location  for all or part \nof their workweek.  Din\n College  considers  telecommuting  to be a viable,  flexible  work  option  when \nboth the employee and the job are suited to such an arrangement. Telecommuting may be \nappropriate for some employees and jobs but not for others. Telecommuting is not an entitlement \nor right; it is not a College -wide benefit; and it in no way changes the terms and conditions of \nemployment with the College.  \nII. Procedures  \nTelecommuting  can be informal,  such as working  from  home  for a short -term project  or on the road \nduring  business  travel.  It can alternatively  be formally  arranged  for a longer  period  of time with a \nset schedule of working away from the office as described below. Either an employee or a \nsupervisor can suggest telecommuting as a possible work arrangement.  \nAny telecommuting arrangement made will be on a trial basis for the first three months and may \nbe discontinued at will and at any time, including within the three -month period, at the request of \neither the tele commuter or the College. Whomever initiates the discontinuation of the \ntelecommuting  will make  a good  faith effort  to provide  thirty  (30) days prior  notice  of such change \nto accommodate commuting, childcare and other issues that may arise from the terminat ion of a \ntelecommuting arrangement. There may be instances, however, when no notice is possible.  \n1. Eligibility  \nWith  the exception  of ad hoc arrangement  appropriately  approved  by the employee’s  manager \nunder the guidance of the human resource department, indi viduals requesting formal \ntelecommuting  arrangements  must  be employed  with the College  for a minimum  of 12 months \nof continuous, regular employment and must have a satisfactory performance record.  \nBefore entering into any telecommuting agreement, the eligible employee and manager, with \nthe assistance of the human resource department, will evaluate the suitability of such an \narrangement, reviewing the following areas:  \nA. Employee  suitability.  The employee  and manager  will assess  the needs  and work  habits  of \nthe employee, compared to traits customarily recognized as appropriate for successful \ntelecommuters.  \nB. Job responsibilities. The employee and manager will discuss the job responsibilities and \ndetermine if the job is appropriate for a telecommuting arrange ment.  \nC. Equipment needs, workspace design considerations and scheduling issues. The employee \nand manager  will review  the physical  workspace  needs  and the appropriate  location  for the \ntelework.  \nD. Tax and other legal implications. The employee must determine any  tax or legal \nimplications under IRS, state and local government laws, and/or restrictions of working out \nof a home -based office. Responsibility for fulfilling all obligations in this area rests solely \nwith the employee.  172  If the employee and m anager agree, and the human resource department concur, a draft \ntelecommuting agreement will be prepared and signed by all parties, and a three -month trial \nperiod will commence.  \nEvaluation  of telecommuter  performance  during  the trial period  will include  regular  interaction \nby phone  and e-mail between  the employee  and the manager,  and weekly  face-to-face meetings \nto discuss work progress and problems. At the end of the trial period, the employee and manager  \nwill each complete  an evaluation  of the arrangement  and make  recommendations  for \ncontinuance  or modifications.  Evaluation  of telecommuter  performance  beyond  the trial period \nwill be consistent with that received by employees working at the office in both content and \nfrequency.  \nAn appropriate level of communication between the telecommuter and supervisor will be \nagreed  to as part of the discussion  process  and will be more  formal  during  the trial period.  After \nconclusion of the trial period, the manager and telecommuter will communicate at a level \nconsis tent with employees working at the office or in a manner and frequency that is \nappropriate for the job and the individuals involved.  \n2. Equipment  \nOn a case -by-case basis, Din\n College will determine, with information supplied by the \nemployee  and the superviso r, the appropriate  equipment  needs  (including  hardware,  software, \nmodems, phone and data lines and other office equipment) for each telecommuting \narrangement. The Human Resource and Information Technology Departments will serve as \nresources  in this matter.  Equipment  supplied  by the College  will be maintained  by the College. \nEquipment  supplied  by the employee,  if deemed  appropriate  by the College,  will be maintained \nby the employee. The College accepts no responsibility for damage or repairs to employee - \nowned equipment. The College reserves the right to make determinations as to appropriate \nequipment,  subject  to change  at any time.  Equipment  supplied  by the College  is to be used for \nbusiness purposes only. The telecommuter must sign an inventory of all College property \nreceived and agree to take appropriate action to  protect the items from damage or theft. Upon \ntermination of employment, all College property will be returned, unless other arrangements \nhave been made.  \nThe College will supply the employee with appropriate office supplies (pens, paper, etc.) as \ndeemed necessary. The College will also reimburse the employee for business -related \nexpenses, such as phone calls and shipping costs, that are reasonably incurred in carrying out \nthe employee’s job.  \nThe employee  will establish  an appropriate  work  environment  within  his or her home  for work \npurposes. Din\n College will not be responsible for costs associated with the setup of the \nemployee’s home office, such as remodeling, furniture or lighting, nor for repairs or \nmodifications to the home office space.  \n3. Security  and Privacy  \nConsistent with the College’s expectations of information security for employees working at \nthe office, telecommuting employees will be expected to ensure the protection of proprietary  \nCollege and other information accessible from their home office. Steps include the use of \nlocked file cabinets and desks, regular password maintenance, and any other measures \nappropriate for the job and the environment.  \nThe College may monitor and inspect  and employees’ home computer and communications \nwhere warranted and consistent with the College’s current monitoring policies.  \n4. Safety  173  Employees are expected to maintain their home workspace in a safe manner, free from safety \nhazards. The Col lege will provide each telecommuter with a safety checklist that must be \ncompleted  at least twice  per year.  Injuries  sustained  by the employee  in a home  office  location \nand in conjunction with his or her regular work duties are normally covered by the College’s \nworkers’ compensation policy. Telecommuting employees are responsible for notifying the \nemployer of such injuries as soon as practicable. The employee is liable for any injuries \nsustained by visitors to his or her home worksite.  \nTelecommuting is not designed to be a replacement for appropriate child care. Although an \nindividual employee’s schedule may be modified to accommodate child care needs, the focus \nof the arrangement must remain on job performance and meeting business demands. \nProspective t elecommuters are encouraged to discuss expectations of telecommuting with \nfamily members prior to entering a trial period.  \n5. Time  Worked  \nTelecommuting employees who are not exempt from the overtime requirements of the Fair \nLabor  Standards  Act will be require d to accurately  record  all hours  worked  using  the College’s \ntime-keeping system. Hours worked in excess of those scheduled per day and per workweek \nrequire the advance approval of the telecommuter’s supervisor. Failure to comply with this \nrequirement may r esult in the immediate termination of the telecommuting agreement.  \n6. Ad Hoc Arrangements  \nTemporary  telecommuting  arrangements  may be approved  even  for employees  who have  been \nemployed  less than twelve  (12) months  for circumstances  such as emergency  health  situations, \ninclement  weather,  disability  accommodations,  special  projects  or circumstances  as determined \nby the College President. These arrangements are approved by the appropriate Administrator \nin consultation  with the Department  of Human  Resources  on an as-needed  basis  only,  with no \nexpectation of ongoing continuance. Where the situation warrants, the College President may \norder employees to telecommute.  \nOther informal, short -term arrangements may be made for employees on family or medical \nleave to the extent practical for the employee and the College and with the consent of the \nemployee’s health care provider in cases where the College has concerns about the ability of \nthe employee to safely work from home.  \nAll ad hoc telecommuting  arrangements  are made  on a case-by-case basis,  focusing  first on the \nCollege’s business needs.  \nIII.

Although FMLOA is unpaid, the College requires that \nemployees use any available annual leave, sick leave, and Short -Term Disability benefits if \napplicable, concurrently with the FMLOA. If an employee taking FMLOA has available annual \nleave and/or sick leave, he/she must also comply with the procedural requirements pertaining to \nsuch leave. Please contact the Department of Human Resources if you have any questions.  \nII. Procedures  \n1. Eligibility  \nTo be eligible  for FMLOA,  an employee  (faculty  or staff member  employed  by the College  on \na full-time,  part-time or temporary  basis)  must  have  been  employed  by the College  for at least \ntwelve (12) months and have worked for at least 1,250 hours during the twelve (12) month \nperiod immediately preceding the start of the FMLOA. Periods of approved military leave \nshould be counted when calculating these hours of service requirements for FMLOA. The \nemployee must also be employed at a worksite of the College where fifty (50) or more \nemployees are employed by the College within seventy -five (75) miles of that worksite.  \n2. Qualifie d Leave  Reasons  \nThe College  will grant  FMLOA  to eligible  employees  for the following  reasons:  \nA. The employee's  serious  health  condition;  \nB. The birth  and care of the employee's  child;  \nC. Placement  with the employee  of a child  for adoption  or foster  care;  \nD.

Because  care is required  for a family  member  or next of kin who is a member  of the armed \nforces,  including  a member  of the National  Guard  or Reserves,  who is undergoing  medical \ntreatment, recuperation, or therapy, or is otherwise in outpatient status on the temporary \ndisability retired list, for a serious injury or illness.  \nG. Leave  for the birth  and care, or placement  and care of a child  must  conclude  within  twelve  \n(12) months of the birth or placement of the child. FMLOA applies equally to male and \nfemale employees.  \n3. Notice  and Scheduling  Requirements  \nEmployees seeking FMLOA leave should provide their su pervisors and the College's \nDepartment of Human Resources at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of the proposed \nleave.  Where  advance  notice  is not possible,  such as in the event  of a medical  emergency,  notice \nshould  be given  as soon  as practicable.  Within  five (5) business  days after receipt  of the request \nfor LOA, the Department of Human Resources will notify the employee if the request is \ndesignated as FMLOA.  \n4. In addition, an employee on FMLOA is required to contact the Department of Human \nResources every thirty (30) calendar days.  Failure to do so shall be considered voluntary \ntermination.  \n5. Employees using intermittent FMLOA or FMLOA on a reduced schedule must make a \nreasonable effort to avoid disrupting College operations, including s cheduling doctor's \nappointments outside  of work  hours.  An employee using intermittent FMLOA due to medical \nnecessity should notify his/her supervisor as soon as he/she knows that he/she will be unable \nto work, but no later than the starting time of the sta ff member's work day. A staff member \nmust notify his/her supervisor on each day of absence unless other arrangements have been \nmade.  \n6. Failure to follow this policy may delay or postpone the commencement of the leave and/or \nresult in disciplinary action. Ple ase contact the Department of Human Resources for the \napplicable forms.  \n7. Notice  to Staff  Member  \nWhen a staff member has proposed a leave, the supervisor is expected to notify the staff \nmember, in writing, that the College is provisionally designating the le ave as Family/Medical \nLeave of Absence.  \n8. Certification  by Health  Care  Provider  \nIf FMLOA  is based  on a serious  health  condition,  whether  it involves  the employee  or a family \nmember (parent, spouse/same -sex domestic partner or child), medical certification from a \nhealth  care provider  will be required.  Failure  to provide  such certification  may result  in a delay \nof the employee's leave. Where the College requires an employee to provide a medical \ncertification, that certification must be provided within twenty (20) calendar days of the \nCollege's request. Please contact your supervisor or the Department of Human Resources for \navailable  medical  certification  forms.  Employees  should  be aware  that the College  may,  under \ncertain circumstances, require recertification  of a medical condition. In addition, employees \nmay be required to report  on their intent to return to  work. Whenever an employee learns of  a \nchange in the anticipated length of a FMLOA, the employee must notify the College within \ntwo (2) business days of learning of such a change.  \n9. If a leave  request  is based  on a qualifying  exigency  due to active  duty service  or a call to active \nduty service,  the employee  may be required  to provide  a copy  of the active  duty order  or other \nappropriate  documentation,  as well as certification  and documentation  from  the employee  185  containing information supporting the qualifying exigency. When leave is taken to care for a \ncovered service member, the employee may be required to provide certification from an \nauthorize d health care provider.  \n10. Employees  using  FMLOA  are prohibited  from  working  either  in the workplace  or at any other \nlocation,  including  the employee's  home,  whether  for the College  or otherwise.  When  returning \nto work from a leave taken because of the employee's own serious health condition, the \nemployee  will be required  to provide  a return  to work  note from  the treating  physician  prior  to \nreporting back to the workplace.  \n11. Length  of Leave  \nEligible employees may be entitled to up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid leave as FMLOA \nduring any 12 -month period (which period is measured backward from the date an employee \nuses any FMLOA). Each time an employee takes a FMLOA, the remaining leave entitlement \nequals  the balance  of the 12 weeks  that has not been  used during the immediately  preceding  12 \nmonths.  \n12. Where both spouses/same -sex domestic partners are employed by the College, they are each \nentitled to twelve (12) weeks of FMLOA for the birth and care of their newborn child, or for \nthe care and placement with them  of a child for adoption or foster care.  \n13. An eligible employee who is the spouse/same -sex domestic partner, son, daughter, parent, or \nnext of kin of a covered service member shall be entitled to a total of twenty -six (26) \nworkweeks  of FMLOA  during  a twelve  (12) month  period  to care for the service  member.  The \nleave  in this paragraph  shall only be available  during  a single  twelve  (12) month  period,  though \nthat leave entitlement shall be applied on a per -covered -service member, per -injury basis.  \n14. In certain cir cumstances, employees may take intermittent FMLOA or FMLOA on a reduced \nleave schedule. Intermittent FMLOA or FMLOA on a reduced schedule for the birth and care \nor placement and care of a child for adoption or foster care will be allowed only with the \nCollege’s  prior  written  approval.  Intermittent  FMLOA  or FMLOA  on a reduced  schedule  may \nbe taken  whenever  medically  necessary  to care for a seriously  ill family  member  or because  of \nthe employee's own serious health condition.  \n15. Concurrent  Use of Paid Leave  \nWhen an employee takes FMLOA because of the employee's own serious medical condition, \nthe employee must concurrently use any unused annual leave, sick leave, or short -term \ndisability leave during the (otherwise) unpaid FMLOA. Employees will only be paid fo r the \ntime they have available not to exceed six (6) months or one hundred thirty -two (132) \nconsecutive work days including sick leave, annual leave, and short -term disability, in that \norder.  \nPaid leave that is used concurrently with FMLOA taken for a seri ous health condition will be \ncounted toward the 12 weeks of total available FMLOA.  \n16. Benefits  During  Leave  \nDuring  any FMLOA,  the College  will maintain  the employee's  coverage  under  any group  health \nplan on the same  conditions  that coverage  would  have been  provided  if the employee  had been \ncontinuously  employed  during  the entire  leave  period.  The College  and the employee  will each \ncontinue to pay their portion of the benefit costs. In some instances, the College may recover \npremiums  it paid to maintain  healt h coverage  for an employee  who fails to return  to work  from \nFMLOA leave on a prorated basis.  186  17. During  a FMLOA,  sick leave  and annual  leave  will continue  to accrue  only during  that portion \nof the LOA  which  is paid by using  sick or annual  leave.  During  any unpaid  FMLOA,  sick leave \nand annual  leave  will not accrue.  For those  persons  returning  from  any unpaid  FMLOA,  accrual \nof annual leave and sick leave will resume the first of the month which follows or coincides \nwith the date the individual returns to active work. Where the FMLOA is taken on an \nintermittent  basis  or as a reduced -schedule,  sick leave  and annual  leave  will continue  to accrue \nduring the LOA on a pro rata basis.  \n18. Return  from  Leave  \nNormally, employees returning from FMLOA leave will be reinstated to the same or an \nequivalent position, with equivalent pay, benefits and other terms and conditions of \nemployment. However, at times, the College may restructure due to changing business and \noperational needs and the need to continually enhance programs and services. These \nrestructuring initiatives may result in position discontinuations, even positions held by \nemployees out on FMLOA or other types of leave. If the position held by a staff member on \nFMLOA  is discontinued,  he/she will  be given at least thirty (30)  business  days’  written  notice \nof the position  discontinuation  and will be informed  of any applicable  benefits  that he/she  may \nbe eligible to receive.  \n19. Failure to return to work  upon the expiration of FMLOA or refusing an  offer of  reinstatement \nfor which the employee is qualified upon the expiration of FMLOA will be considered \nvoluntary termination.  \n20. Employees returning from FMLOA for a serious health condition must provide supervisors \nwith a certification from a health care provider  documenting their fitness to return to work. \nEmployees who are unable to return to work at the end of the FMLOA should notify their \nsupervisor  in writing  at least two weeks  in advance  and must  have  the physician  re-certify  that \nthe leave is medically nece ssary. Supervisors should contact the Department of Human \nResources to discuss alternatives prior to taking any action if an employee is unable to return \nto work, has exhausted the 12 weeks of FMLOA and/or is out of other approved leave.  \n21. In addition, excep t as provided in this policy, an employee's use of FMLOA will not result in \nthe loss of any employment benefit that the employee earned before using FMLOA. Use of \nFMLOA will not be counted against the employee under a \"no fault\" attendance policy.  \n22. Other  Leave Arrangements  \nThe determination of whether an employee qualifies for FMLOA will be made by the \nDepartment of Human Resources within five (5) business days after receipt of the request for \nFMLOA. If an employee is ineligible for FMLOA or has exhausted his/her 12 weeks, the \nemployee may be entitled to a Personal LOA. Note that a LOA is subject to the sole approval \nof the College.  \nIII.

LOA is granted by the College to guarantee employees’ continued employment.  \nIf an employee finds that he/she must be out of work for more than 3 days, he/she should contact \nthe Department of H uman Resources to determine if a LOA may be necessary. The appropriate \nAdministrator has the authority to approve/disapprove the LOA.  \nThe maximum amount of LOA time an employee is allowed to take in any combination of LOAs \n(both Personal and Family/Medical ) is 18 weeks in a 12 month time period measured backward \nfrom the date an employee begins a leave of absence (rolling period).  \nLOAs  will start on the date of request  or date of need;  therefore,  not after the exhaustion  of Annual \nLeave. While on LOA, an employee must contact the Department of Human Resources at least \nevery 30 days. Failure to contact the Department of Human Resources every 30 days may be \nconsidered  voluntary  termination.  Failure  to return  to work  upon  the expiration  of LOA  or refusing \nan offer of reinstatement for which the employee is qualified will also be considered voluntary \ntermination.  \nII. Procedures  \nRequired  Documentation  – All requests  for a Personal  LOA  must  be made  on an \"Extended  Leave \nof Absence  Request  Form  and submitted  to the immediate  supervisor.  An employee  must  provide \nthirty (30) calendar days advance notice when the need for the LOA is foreseeable.

The \nAdministrator  will notify  the employee  as to whether  the request  was approved  or the reason  it \nwas denied. A leave of absence will not be granted to allow an e mployee time off to seek \nemployment elsewhere or to work for another employer. Employees who begin employment \nelsewhere while on LOA, except military reserve duty, are considered to have resigned \nvoluntarily.  \n2. Job Benefits  \nThe College  will pay its portion  of the cost of the employee's  benefits  including  health,  life and \ndisability insurance benefits while an employee is on approved LOA. The employee must \ncontinue  to pay his/her  portion  of the benefits  which  may be made  by payroll  deductions  (when \napplicable)  or by check  which  must  be submitted  to the Department  of Human  Resources  each \npay period unless other arrangements have been made.

Therefore, the disciplinary procedures set forth herein is a \ngeneral guide to employee discipline.  \nWhile  the appropriate  Administrator  achieves  to maintain  fair practices  with all employees,  unusual \nor particular  circumstances may warrant  or require the  Administrator  to take action,  or fail to take \naction,  in a manner  different  from  that described  in this manual  or used in other \nsituations.

Policy  \nAdministrators must exercise judgment when imposing penalties for misconduct, as mitigating or \naggravating circumstances may warrant lesser or more severe penalties.  \nTo determine mitigating circumstances, a supervisor shall consider the employee's work \nperformance, recognition for outstanding work, contributions to the College, lack of disciplinary \nrecord,  degree of fault of the employee,  willingness  of the employee  to accept  responsibility  for the \nmisconduct, and other similar factors favorable to the employee.  \nTo determine aggravating circumstances, a supervisor shall consider the employee's work \nperformance,  prior  misconduct,  injury  or property  damage  resulting  from  misconduct,  exposure  of \nthe College to liability, effect on morale of employees, breach of ethical responsibilities, whether \nthe misconduct is unlawful, and other factors making misconduct more injurious to the College.  \nII.

Policy  \nThe purpose of disciplinary action is to communicate and document performance concerns or \npolicy violations  in an effort to correct performance  or discipline  employees if performance  is not \ncorrected  and sustained.  An individual  discussion  is strongly  recommended  to assist  the employee \nto improve work performance or comply with policies and procedures.  Discussion should be a \ncooperative attempt at identifying and correcting performance problems.  Supervisors need to \ndocument the discussion with the employee.  \nAn employe e is required to abide by the established rules and policies of his/her department, the \nCollege and the Board of Regents.  \nSince the College emphasizes the constructive aspect of disciplinary procedures, a supervisor has \nthe responsibility  of outlining  depa rtmental  policies  and performance  expectations.  The supervisor \nshould advise an employee on any aspect of work performance that fails to meet standards and \nprovide an opportunity for improvement.  With the exception of gross misconduct, a supervisor will \ninitiate a disciplinary action only after addressing performance concerns with the employee, \nallowing the employee an opportunity for self -correction, and finding that performance remains \nunsatisfactory.  Accordingly,  such a supervisory  action  should  be appropriate  to the seriousness  of \nthe infraction or the performance deficiency  \nII. Procedures  \n1. Progressive  Disciplinary  \nDin\n College has adopted progressive disciplinary procedures. These are a series of disciplinary \nactions that are corrective in nature and ar e taken to provide employees the opportunity to \nimprove job performance and abide by College policies. Such actions range from  providing  a \nverbal  warning  to separation  of employment  when  deemed  appropriate  by the appropriate \nAdministrator.  \nA. Termination  is appropriate  only where  there  is “substantial  misconduct,”  with concurrence \nof the Director of Human Resources. It is recognized that in cases of “gross misconduct,” \nserious  disciplinary  measure,  including  separation  of employment,  without  prior  discipline \nmay be imposed.  \nB. Except in cases of “gross misconduct” as described below, all disciplinary actions should \nfollow progressive disciplinary procedures as appropriate. It is recognized that certain \ninfractions may warrant the imposition of serious disciplinar y measures, including \ntermination, without prior discipline having been imposed.  \n2. A Department/School/Division Administrator is authorized to take actions, including \nreprimand, suspension, demotion, or separation of employment, subject to the guidelines of \nthis policy.  All disciplinary  actions  taken  should  be proportionate  to the offending  conduct.  For \nexample, a reprimand may be suitable for a minor policy infraction, but separation of \nemployment may be appropriate in a case of gross misconduct. Violations of College policy  199  against discrimination and sexual misconduct will result in specific disciplinary measures, \nwhich may include separation of employment.  \n3. Types  of Pre-Disciplinary  Action  \nA. A verbal  warning  is a documented  verbal  warning  of the current  problem  and may lead  to \nfuture disciplinary action if improvement does not occur. A verbal warning is not subject \nto the grievance procedure by an employee, since no punitive action has been taken.  \nVerbal warnings should be given in a respectful ma nner with the intent of facilitating a \npositive employer -employee relationship, encouraging the warned employee’s personal \naccountability and self -correction. The supervisor giving the warning should clearly \nidentify the problems created by the employee’s conduct and to the extent practical allow \nthe counseled employee to choose to adopt the action necessary to remedy the problem.  \nB. A written  warning  is used for failure  to meet  job requirements  or violations  of rules  and/or \npolicies, or when the employee has failed to correct his/her conduct in response to the \nverbal  warning.  Written  warnings  shall  specify the  performance  concerns  and what  action \nis required to correct them.  \nA written  warning  shall  explicitly  state that it is a “written  warning”  and the superv isor will \nprovide  a copy  to the employee  and retain  a copy  in the department  file. This letter  will not \nbecome part of the employee’s official personnel file maintained by the Department of \nHuman Resources. A warning is not subject to the grievance procedure by an employee, \nsince no punitive action has been taken.  \n4. Types  of Disciplinary  Action  \nA. A written reprimand is the least severe form of disciplinary action and is typically given \nafter a written  warning  or other  performance  feedback  has failed  to improve  the employee’s \nconduct  or performance.  It may be  appropriate  to use this form  of discipline  without  prior \nwarnings  in certain  circumstances.  A written  reprimand  is different  from  a written  warning \nin that a copy is placed in the employee's official  personnel file in the Department of Human \nResources and a reprimand is subject to the grievance policy.  \nB. Disciplinary  Suspension  is the temporary  release  of an employee  from  duty.  It is applicable \nwhen  a violation  or violations  of applicable  rules  or policies  are serious  enough  to warrant \nsuspension.  \nA disciplinary  suspension  should  be applied  in proportion  to the significance  of the offense \nbut shall  not exceed  fifteen  (15) consecutive  work  days.  An employee  does not receive  pay \nfor periods of discipl inary suspension; however, benefit programs continue in force. This \naction is subject to the grievance policy and must be approved by the Department \nAdministrator.  \nC. Involuntary Demotion is the reassigning of an employee to a lower position at a lower \ngrade as the result of disciplinary action and must be approved by the Department \nAdministrator. This action is subject to the grievance policy.  \nD. Dismissal, the involuntary separation of employment, is the most serious form of \ndiscipline. Prior to making a final decision to dismiss an employee, the Department \nAdministrator  must  have  the concurrence  of the Director  of Human  Resources.  This action \nis subject to the grievance policy.  \n5. Disciplinary  Conference  \nBefore a non -probationary employee is disciplined, the appro priate administrator is strongly \nencouraged to hold  a pre -disciplinary  conference. A  pre-disciplinary  conference  is not required  200  for verbal  or written  warnings.  Department  Administrators  will consult  with the Department  of \nHuman Resources pri or to holding a pre -disciplinary conference.  \nA pre-disciplinary  conference  is a meeting  in which  the Department  Administrator  informs  the \nemployee of possible disciplinary action, considers the employee’s input about performance \nand possible  disciplinary  action  and renders  a decision  to the employee  verbally  and in writing.  \nDuring  the pre-disciplinary  conference,  the employee  is allowed  to: \nA. Correct any errors in the information or facts upon which it proposes to take disciplinary \naction; and  \nB. Tell his/her side of the story and present any mitigating information as to why the \ndisciplinary action should not be taken.  \nC. Since a disciplinary conference is not an administrative hearing, witness testimony is not \nallowed.  \nD. Although the employee may request the presen ce of a representative at the disciplinary \nconference, the employee’s representative is only allowed to observe, not actively \nparticipate  in the disciplinary  conference.  Upon  completion  of the disciplinary  conference, \na summary of the conference should be completed and forwarded to the Department of \nHuman Resources, with a copy maintained by the administrator and the employee.  \n6. Notification  of Disciplinary  Action  \nAt the time disciplinary  action  is taken,  the employee  shall  be notified  in writing.  The content s \nof the disciplinary notice shall contain:  \nA. An appropriate  identification  of the employee,  including  position,  title and department.  \nB. The date(s)  on which  the unsatisfactory  performance,  violation  or misconduct  occurred,  or \nthe period of time when the acts occurred if such acts were of a continuing nature.  \nC. If the misconduct is referenced in the Table of Consequences, a specification of the \nmisconduct committed and the applicable penalty.  \nD. A clear and concise statement of the facts supporting the disciplinary notice, including \npolicies violated, and whether the misconduct is simple, serious, or aggravated as defined \nherein, together with witnesses interviewed and documents reviewed.  \nE. A clear and concise statement of the disciplinary action(s) and/or penalty impo sed \nincluding a statement of the mitigating and aggravating circumstances supporting such \naction. It is possible, in certain situations, to apply more than one form of disciplinary \naction at a time.  \nF. An explanation of the employee's right to grieve the disc iplinary action according to the \ngrievance policy, if the employee has appeal rights pursuant to this policy.  \nIII. Definitions  \n1. Gross  Misconduct  \nMeans any conduct engaged in by an employee that violate these policies or the law and \nimposes  an immediate  threat  to the physical  or emotional  safety  and well-being  to an individual \nor individuals in the College community.  \nIV. Form(s)  and/or  Equipment  \nThere  are no forms  and/or  equipment  associate  with this policy.  201  \n \nPersonnel  Policies  and \nProcedures Manual   \nDiscipline/Grievance:  \nSection  8.04 \nAdoption  Date:  07-31-2019  \nEffective  Date : 09-02-2019  \nPolicy:  Table  of Consequences  Applicability:  All Employees  \nReference(s):  \n \nI. Policy  \nThe Table  of Consequences  (Table)  is a guide  for disciplinary  action.  Depending  on the severity  of \nthe violation, more severe penalties may be imposed where warranted.  \nII. Procedures  \n1. Guidance  on Table  of Consequences  \nA. The Table is a listing of standard consequences for some of the possible violations. The \nTable  is intended  to be used as a guide,  only in an effort  to assure  consistency  of penalties \nfor like violations. The Nature of Misconduct section sets forth general categories of \nviolations and is not intended to be all -inclusive, nor does it address every disciplinary \nsituation.  \nB. The Tab le does not preclude the exercise of supervisory judgment in imposing penalties \nfor misconduct, as mitigating or aggravating circumstances may warrant lesser or more \nsevere  penalties  than called  for in the Table.  However,  deviation  from  the standard  penalt y \nwill require written justification. Violations need not be identical in order to warrant \nprogressively  more  severe  disciplinary  action.  For example,  an employee  who has received \na warning for unauthorized absence can receive a reprimand for sleeping on duty, and \npossibly be suspended or removed for a third violation unrelated to the two previous \nviolations. Likewise, when a combination or series of violations have been committed, a \ngreater penalty than is listed for a single violation is appropriate.  \nC. The Table lists only formal disciplinary actions (i.e., those, which become a matter of \nrecord in the employee's official personnel folder). Although prior verbal and/or written \ncounseling are not considered formal disciplinary actions, such counseling may be  \nconsidered when assessing the appropriate penalty for a particular offense.  \nD. The Table does not cover all violations for which disciplinary penalties may be imposed. \nThe Table is an illustration of possible disciplinary penalties that could be imposed. \nRemedial action will be taken whenever required by policy or regulation or whenever \nwarranted by the facts in the individual case. Normally, progressively more severe penalties \nwill be administered, unless the aggravating circumstances warrant immediate separ ation \nof employment.  \n2.

This policy  provides  a process  by which  the employee  is allowed  to seek equitable \nmeans for a resolution of employee/employer problems.  \n1. Prohibition  Against  Retaliation  \nRetaliation against an employee for raising an issue or participating in any way in dispute \nresolution under this policy is strictly forbidden. Any employee found retaliating against \nanother employee shall be cause for disciplinary action.  \n2. Confidentiality  \nInformation obtained by the Department Human Re sources staff in the course of facilitation, \ninformal attempts at resolution, or other activities is confidential to the extent allowed by \nNavajo Nation law.  At the initial visit, the Director of Human Resources will explain any \nlimitations to confidential ity before discussing specific issues.  \n3. Supervisory  Responsibility  \nSupervisors at all levels are responsible for resolving work -related issues and problems in an \nappropriate, fair, and prompt manner as soon as reasonably possible after becoming aware of \nthe issues  or problems.  Supervisors  are encouraged  to employ  K’é measures  when  addressing \nissues with employees. This includes, where practicable, employing tactics that facilitate a \npositive  employer -employee  relationship.  For example,  verbal  warnings  should  be given  where \npossible. During these verbal warning session, the supervisor should clearly and respectfully \nidentify the problem caused by the employee’s conduct and leave it up to the employee to \nidentify what measures she or he should take to self -correct. Supervisors are not required to \nemploy these measures and should proceed immediately to disciplinary action in cases where \nimmediate action is required to prevent or stop conduct that places individuals or the College \ncommunity at risk of physical, fi nancial, or emotional harm.  \n4.

Step 1: Informal  discussion  with supervisor  \nEmployee  concerns  should  first be discussed  with the employee's  immediate  supervisor.

Policy  \nThe College recognizes that employees, as part of their normal teaching and other scholarly \nactivities, may develop materials, which, in the interest of the author and the College, should be \nprotected  by copyrights.  Accordingly,  it is considered  desirable  to provide  policies  and procedures \nthat; (1) Assist faculty and staff in realizing tangible benefits from their creative efforts; (2) \nEstablish guidelines  for defining  the rights of  ownership to materi als produced by faculty or staff; \nand (3) Ensure  control  of use, within  the College  structure,  of curriculum  material  developed  at the \nCollege by a faculty or staff member.  \nII. Procedures  \n1. General  Principles  \nThis policy is applicable to all units of the College  including its departments, divisions, \nprograms, laboratories, academies, centers, and institutes and to all College employees \nincluding faculty, instructors, and staff. Employees receiving salaries or other remuneration \nfrom the College, including part -time employees, student employees, College employees on \nsabbatical who receive remuneration from the College, and employees on a leave of absence \nwho are using  substantial  College  resources  are bound  by this policy.  The Provost  is the College \nAdministrator w ho is authorized to approve exemptions to individuals bound by this policy.  \nStudents  are covered  under  this policy  under  the following  circumstances.  A student  who is not \nemployed  by the College  or has not used substantial  College  resources  to develop  educational \nmaterials,  will own the materials  she or he  creates,  unless  the student's  work  is part of a larger \nwork  over which  the College  has rights  and intends  to exercise  them.  Students  who hold awards \nsuch as scholarships or fellowships through the Col lege on which a funding body has placed \nrestrictions as to intellectual property of educational materials developed during the course of \nthe award will be bound by this policy.  \nA. Substantial  Use of Resources  \nThe use of College resources that goes above and beyond those that are customarily and \ncurrently provided to College employees. College resources include such things as \nequipment,  staff support,  supplemental  pay, and offloading  from  regular  duties.  Decisions \nabout whether use of these resources is \"subst antial\" or \"customary and current\" shall be \ndetermined by the department/academic unit or school. The College does not assign its \ninterests in the intellectual property created  by College employees making substantial use \nof College resources.  \nB. Education  Materials  \nWhile current copyright law generally allocates ownership rights to the College as an \nemployer,  the College  agrees  to make  no ownership  claims  on intellectual  property  by the \nperson or people who create Education Materials, except under the special circumstances \nas described in this policy. This policy shall act as an assignment of all copyrights in \nscholarly  and artistic  work  such as, but not limited  to, textbooks,  electronic  media,  syllabi, \ntests,  assignments,  monographs,  papers,  models,  musical  compositions,  works  of art and 212  unpublished manuscripts, as the sole and exclusive property of the person or people who \ncreate Education Materials. Exceptions are:  \ni. Those  cases  in which  the production  of such materials  is part of sponsored  programs;  \nii. Those cases in which the materials are created under the specifically assigned duties \nof employees other than faculty;  \niii. Those cases in which substantial College resources were used in creating educational \nmaterials; and  \niv. Those cases which are specifica lly commissioned by the College contract or done as \npart of an explicitly designated assignment other than normal faculty scholarly pursuits.  \nIf, during the preparation of the material, the College incurs significant costs supported \nby salary, equipment, College resources or other operational expenses, the author must \nreimburse the College for these costs in order to obtain full equity in the copyright. \\ \nIn cases  where  it is not clear  whether  or not these  exemptions  apply,  creators  are strongly \nencouraged  to pursue  a negotiated  written  agreement  as stipulated  in Section  (H) below.  \nC. Rights  to Educational  Materials  \nRights  of the person  or people  who create  Educational  Materials  created  for classroom  and \nlearning  programs,  including  electronic  media,  such as syllabi,  assignments,  and tests,  shall \nbe the property of the creator.  \nD. Rights  of the College  \nWhile the person or people who create Educational Materials shall own the rights to all \nEducational  Materials  developed  pursuant  to this policy,  the College  shall  be permitted  to \nuse such Educational Materials for administrative purposes, such as satisfying requests of \naccreditation agencies for faculty -authored syllabi, assessments and course descriptions. \nSuch usage shall extend beyond employment with the College.  \nE. Copyright  of Professional  Journals  and Books  \nConsistent with the terms of this policy, the College assigns any interest and ownership \nclaims on publication of research and/or other scholarly materials and activities that \ntypically  occur  in professional/academic  journals,  books,  and other  professional  resources. \nNothing in this policy shall be construed to restrict or constrain these actions.  \nF. Duty  to Disclose  and Reporting  Requirements  \nAny person formally affiliated with the College shall be obligated to report in a timely \nmanner  any efforts  to create  educational  materials  that might  fall under  the authority  of any \nCollege policies. Such reporting shall be to the direct supervisor, and, if deemed \nappropriate by the supervisor, to the Provost  \nG. Designation  of responsible  authority  \nThe College President shall designate one or more individuals at the campus level who \nshall be responsible for undertaking an initial assessment of any matters relating to \nEducational  Materials,  including  making  a determ ination  as to whether  substantial  College \nresources  have  been  used,  and whether  a negotiated  agreement  is necessary.  Such  designee \nshall seek out appropriate assistance and expertise from departments as may be necessary \nand shall  be responsible  for developing  any such written  agreement.  The President  shall 213  further designate a central campus repository for all Educational Material matters, \nincluding written agreements and the disposition of any Educational Material matters.  \nH. Negotiated  Written  Agreements  \nIf substantial College resources are used, or their use is anticipated, at any point in the \ncreation of educational materials, then a negotiated written agreement must be signed by \nthe creator(s) and a designated representative from the campus where the educational \nmaterials shall be created. It is the responsibility of the creator to seek clarification of \nwhether the resources being used in the development of educational materials constitute \n\"substantial  use of College  resources.\"  If so, the creator  shall  negotiate  a written  agreement \nwith the College.  \n\"Substantial  use of College  resources\"  in and of itself  does not require  that ownership  rights \nbe automatically  shifted  to the College.  However,  depending  on the terms  of the negotiated \ncontract, \"substantial use of College resources\" may result in an obligation to share \nrevenues, reimburse the College, or confer a license. Ownership rights specified in this \npolicy may be altered by mutual agreement.  \nI. Multiple  Parties  \nIf more than one party i s responsible for creating specific educational materials, a \nnegotiated  written  agreement  signed  by all creators  and the College  shall  be required.  That \nagreement  shall  specify  (1) the rights  of each party  to use, distribute,  and sell the materials; \nand (2) the division  of revenues  between  the parties.  Parties  may include  but are not limited \nto individuals, research teams, external funding agencies, the College, etc.  \n2. Discoveries  and Patents  for Their  Protection  and Commercialization  \nFostering social responsibility, community service, and scholarly research that contribute to the  \nsocial,  economic  and cultural  well-being  of the Navajo  Nation  is a fundamental  mission  for the \nCollege. The creative environment of the College is conducive to the development  of \nintellectual property. A clear and concise policy enhances the environment for development \nand commercialization of intellectual property such as inventions, patents and software.  \nIn this policy the College reaffirms its commitment to academic freedom.  The College also \nencourages and rewards its discoverers and innovators who benefit society and who create \nsignificant economic resources for themselves, their research programs and the College.  \nA. Disclosure  \nUnited States patent law permits the filing of a p atent application within one year of \npublication; however, under foreign patent law, any public disclosure disqualifies the \ninvention or discovery from patent protection. Therefore, to protect academic priority as \nwell as commercial  priority,  any inventor  making  any invention  or discovery  subject  to this \npolicy  is encouraged  to report  it promptly  in writing  and in reasonable  detail  to the Provost, \npreferably within 30 days of making the invention or discovery. Public disclosure of the \nresearch results may affect patent rights.  \nB. College  Ownership  Rights  \nAll inventions or discoveries to which this policy applies are owned by the College. The \nownership rights to an invention  or discovery are the exclusive property of  the inventor if \nthe College  has contributed  nothing  substantial  or essential  (as, for example,  funds,  space, \nmaterials,  or facilities)  to the conception  or development  of the invention  or discovery,  and \nthe invention  or discovery  is outside  the scope  of the inventor's  normal  field of employment \nresponsibility  and activity  within  the College.  Where  the College  has entered  into an 214  agreement for a project sponsored by a government agency or private firm, the terms of \nthat agreement will govern the disposition of patents and licenses.  \nMembers of the College community who enter into consulting or other agreements with \nparties outside of the College that require assignment of ownership rights in intellectual \nproperty are cautioned that conflicting interests may arise. For guidance in thes e matters, \nrefer  to the College’s  Conflict  of Interest  policy.  The inventor's  supervisor  and the Provost \nmust  be notified  of any patents  or inventions  arising  from  external  consulting  agreements.  \nWhere there is disagreement among the inventors or the inven tors and the College as to \nownership rights or the retention of rights by the College, the President shall appoint an \nIntellectual Property Committee to review the case and provide a recommendation, with \nsupporting rationale, for resolving the disagreement . After review of any information and \nrecommendation  from  the Intellectual  Property  Committee  the President  will make  a final \ndecision to resolve the disagreement.  \n3. Obtaining  a Patent  and Release  of Intellectual  Property  Rights  \nFollowing disclosure of an invention or discovery to the College by the inventor, the Provost \nshall make reasonable efforts to determine the potential commercial use and patentability of \nthe invention or discovery and shall seek to make such contractual arrangements as may be \napprop riate for development of commercial use. When, in the judgment of the College, there \nappears to be sound basis for proceeding, the College will apply for a patent at no expense to \nthe inventor. The College will own the invention and any patent obtained. Th e inventor is \nexpected to cooperate and participate in obtaining patent protection, including signatures on \nappropriate documents. If the inventor consults with another patent counsel, he/she must bear \nall of the expense, realizing that final responsibilit y for prosecution rests with the College.  \nIf the College does not file a patent application, the Provost will so notify the inventor, \npreferably  within  one-hundred  eighty  (180)  calendar  days from  full disclosure  of the discovery \nto the College, and the Col lege will release its rights in the invention or discovery to the \ninventor. The inventor may elect to seek a patent or to continue prosecution at his/her own \nexpense. If the College desires to terminate the application for a patent after initiating the \napplication process, the Provost will so notify the inventor, and the College will release its \nrights in the invention or discovery to the inventor, subject to the inventor's agreeing to \nreimburse the College for any costs incurred by the College in obtaining , maintaining, or \nmarketing the patent before its release to the inventor. Such reimbursement is payable from \nproceeds  received  by the inventor  from  the invention,  whether  by license,  sale, or otherwise.  If \nthe inventor declines to accept the patent, the C ollege, at its discretion, may abandon the \nproperty at no cost to the inventor.  \n4. Inventions  and Discoveries  Arising  from  Sponsored  Projects  \nThe intellectual property terms of all research agreements are governed by the following \nprinciples.  \nA. The investigator  is free to publish  or present  the results  of a sponsored  project,  subject  only \nto contractually  agree  upon  delays  to permit  the sponsor  to review  the proposed  publication \nor presentation for the use of the sponsor's confidential information and the inclus ion of \npatentable information.  \nB. In those  cases  where  the College  agrees  to respect  the proprietary  nature  of a sponsor's  data \ndisclosed to the College for certain limited purposes, all persons working on the project \n(faculty, staff, and students) are required to treat the sponsor's data as confidential.  215  C.
